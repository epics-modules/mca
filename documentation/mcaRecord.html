<A NAME="Overview">
<H2>Overview</H2></A>
<P>
This documentation describes version 4.0 of the MCA record.
<P>
The MCA record controls and acquires data from a multichannel analyzer
(MCA).  Currently, there are 3 supported multichannel analyzers.
<OL>

<LI> The Canberra model 556 AIM (Acquisition Interface Module), 
a NIM module that 
communicates with EPICS via ethernet (using IEEE 802 extended), and that can 
function as a pulse-height analyzer, a multichannel scaler, and a 
voltage sampler.  See the
<A HREF="dev_mca_aim.html">AIM device support documentation</A> for more
information.
<P>
<LI> The X-ray Instrumentation Associates DXP-4, a DSP based CAMAC module 
which replaces the spectroscopy amplifier, ADC and MCA of a conventional
spectroscopy system.  One CAMAC module supports up to 4 detectors.
See the
<A HREF="dev_mca_dxp.html">DXP device support documentation</A> for more
information.
<P>
<LI> The Struck STR-7201 multiscaler, a VME module with 32 inputs which
functions as a multichannel scaler. 
See the
<A HREF="dev_mca_struck.html">Struck STR-7201 device support 
documentation</A> for more information.

</OL>

<P>
The MCA record is unlike most other EPICS records in that its
processing is neither "synchronous" nor "asynchronous" (as these terms
are used in the EPICS Record Reference Manual).  Currently, PACT is
always FALSE after record processing has completed, even though a read
operation may be pending a callback from device support.

</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>VAL</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Current value"</TD> <TD>DBF_xxx (array)</TD>
<TD>The data array of the MCA.  
The data type of the array is set by the FTVL field.  The maximum size of
this array is determined by the NMAX field at IOC initialization.  The actual
array length used is determined by the NUSE field.
Note: Current device support only permits reading of
this field, but future enhancements may permit writing to this field.</TD>
</TR>


<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>BG</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Background"</TD> <TD>DBF_xxx (array)</TD>
<TD>
Array into which the record writes background data that it calculates
from the data array and from regions of interest defined by the
fields RnLO and RnHI (see, e.g., R0LO, R0HI below).
<P>
The record also uses this array to show the user where ROIs are:
The first and last channels of an ROI are set to the largest value in
the data array.  The intervening channels are set to the background
values calculated for those channels.  This behavior is a temporary
kludge to help users set ROIs using a generic channel-access client.</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TH COLSPAN=5> Control Fields<BR>
(Note: Not all device support modules support all of these fields.  See the
relevant device support documentation for details.)
</TH>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>STRT</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Start Acquire"</TD> <TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>Writing a nonzero value to this field causes the MCA to begin
data acquisition.  The record immediately resets this field to zero.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>STOP</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Stop Acquire"</TD> <TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
Writing a nonzero value to this field causes the MCA to stop
data acquisition.  The record immediately resets this field to zero.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>ACQG</TD> <TD>R</TD> <TD>"Acquiring"</TD> <TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
When the user sets the STRT field to 1 ("Start Acquiring"), a "start data
acquisition" command will be sent to the hardware.  If that
command is correctly acknowledged, the ACQG field will be set to
1 ("Acquire").  When the user sets STOP to 1 ("Stop Acquiring", 
or when the hardware signals that data acquisition is finished,
the ACQG field is set to 0 ("Done"), and a
read operation (see READ/RDNG below) is initiated if one is not
already in progress.  Thus, ACQG will be 1 ("Acquire") while data
acquisition is underway, and 0 ("Done") otherwise.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>READ</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Read array"</TD> <TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
Put's to the READ field initiate or abort reading of the MCA's data.
When the user sets READ to 1 ("Read"), a read command will be sent
to the hardware.  If that command is correctly acknowledged, the RDNG
field (below) will be set to 1 ("Read").  When device support [or the
user] sets READ to 0 ("Done") and triggers record processing, the
read operation is finished [or aborted], and the RDNG field is set to
0 ("Done").  Note that all existing device support is synchronous, i.e.
setting READ to 1 causes the record to process and the read operation is
completed immediately, setting READ back to 0 and never setting RDNG to 1.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>RDNG</TD> <TD>R</TD> <TD>Reading array</TD> <TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
Put's to the READ field [above] initiate or abort reading of the MCA's data.
When the user sets READ to 1 ("Read"), a read command will be sent
to the hardware.  If that command is correctly acknowledged, the RDNG
field will be set to 1 ("Read").  When device support [or the
user] sets READ to 0 ("Done") and triggers record processing, the
read operation is finished [or aborted], and the RDNG field is set to
0 ("Done").  This field is intended for use with slow MCAs, which require
asynchronous device support.  However, all existing device support 
is synchronous, i.e.
setting READ to 1 causes the record to process and the read operation is
completed immediately, setting READ back to 0 and never setting RDNG to 1.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>ERAS</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>Erase array</TD> <TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
Put's to this field cause the hardware to erase the data array.
When the user sets ERAS to 1 ("Erase") an "erase" command will be
sent to the hardware.  If that command is correctly acknowledged,
the field will immediately be set to 0 ("Done").
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>CHAS</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>Channel-advance source</TD> <TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
If the MCA is in "MCS" (multichannel scaler) mode (see MODE),
put's to this field tell the hardware whether to advance the
current channel according to its internal clock (CHAS = 0 or
"Internal"), or in response to an external channel-advance signal
(CHAS = 1 or "External).  (See the DWEL field.)
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>NUSE</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"# of channels to use"</TD>
<TD>DBF_LONG</TD>
<TD>
Put's to this field tell the hardware how many channels (array
elements) to use for spectrum acquisition.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>SEQ</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Time sequence #"</TD>
<TD>DBF_LONG</TD>
<TD>
Put's to this field tell the hardware which memory region to use for data
acquisition, readout and erasing.  The main use of this field is for
time-resolved spectroscopy, since it permits rapidly changing the location 
of data acquisition, without having to read and erase the acquisition memory 
between successive spectra. 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>DWEL</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Dwell time per channel"</TD> 
<TD>DBF_FLOAT</TD>
<TD>
Put's to the DWEL field tell the hardware how many seconds to
spend in each channel, when the hardware is in "MCS"
(multichannel scaler) mode (see MODE), and the channel-advance
source is "Internal" (see CHAS).
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>PRTM</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Preset real time"</TD> 
<TD>DBF_FLOAT</TD>
<TD>
Put's to this field tells the hardware for how many seconds to
acquire data, according to a free running clock (real time).  Setting this
field to 0.0 instructs the hardware to ignore it.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>PLTM</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Preset live time"</TD> 
<TD>DBF_FLOAT</TD>
<TD>
Put's to this field tells the hardware for how many seconds to
acquire data, according to a clock which counts only when the hardware is ready
to accept data (live time).  Setting this
field to 0.0 instructs the hardware to ignore it.
</TD>
</TR>


<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>PCT</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Preset counts"</TD> 
<TD>DBF_LONG</TD>
<TD>
Put's to this field tells the hardware that data acquisition is
to be halted when the sum of the numbers of counts acquired in
channels PCTL though PCTH inclusive reaches PCT.  
Setting this field to 0.0 instructs the hardware to ignore it.
</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>PSWP</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Preset number of sweeps"</TD> 
<TD>DBF_LONG</TD>
<TD>
Put's to this field tell the hardware that data acquisition (in
MCS "multichannel scaler" mode; see MODE) is to continue until
PSWP sweeps have completed.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD>MODE</TD> <TD>R/W*</TD> <TD>"Mode PHA/MCS/LIST"</TD> 
<TD>DBF_MENU</TD>
<TD>
Put's to this field tell the hardware in what mode to acquire
data--what to do when an "event" occurs.  (An event is a hardware
trigger that may also clock a digital word into the MCA.)
<P>
MODE=0 ("PHA") is "pulse-height analysis" mode:  each number
presented to the hardware is interpreted as the number of the
channel whose contents are to be incremented by one.
<P>
MODE=1 ("MCS") is "multichannel scaler" mode:  the MCA maintains a
"current channel" number, which increases either with time or in
response to a channel-advance signal (see the CHAS and DWEL
fields), and increments the current channel's contents by one (or
by the number presented to the MCA input, depending on the
hardware) on each event.
<P>
MODE=2 ("List") is "list" mode:  the MCA simply records each event
in the data array.

<TD>
The RnLO and RnHi fields define a region of interest in the data array.  If
(RnLO >= 0) and (RnHI >= RnLO), then the record will calculate
a linear background under the channel range [RnLO..RnHI] (including
channels RnLO and RnHI), sum over this range of channels, post
the sum in the field Rn, and post the sum less background in the
field RnN.  The background at channel RnLO is calculated as the
average over 2m+1 channels centered on RnLO, where 'm' is the value
of the field RnBG.  The background at RnHI is calculated similarly,
and the background in the region between RnLO and RnHI is a linear
interpolation.

<A NAME="Intended">
<H2>Intended Use</H2></A>
<P>
This record should normally have its SCAN field set to "Passive", since
Put's to the STRT and READ fields are intended to cause data acquisition and
data reading to begin immediately, and since Put's to these "process-passive"
fields can trigger record processing only if the record is passive.
<P>
To read data periodically while acquisition is underway, arrange for a '1'
to be poked into the READ field periodically.  The following recipe arranges
for the READ field to be poked periodically while the MCA is acquiring data.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> attach the output link of a "binary-out" (BO) record to the MCA record's
READ field,
<LI> set the BO record's value permanently to 1 (using its DOL field), 
<LI> attach the BO record's scan-disable link (DISL) to the MCA record's
ACQG field,
<LI> set the BO record's scan-disable value (DISV) to 0.
</OL>


<A NAME="Release">
<H2>Release Notes</H2></A>
<P>
<H3>Version 4.0</H3>
The .ADDR and .PORT fields of the record have been eliminated.  The .INP field
is now used to specify the hardware addressing information.  See the 
device documentation for details.
<P>
A new field, .SEQ (sequence) has been added.  This field is used to change the
memory location into which the hardware acquires data, from which data are
read, and where data are erased.  By simply incrementing the .SEQ field it is
possible to rapidly acquire time-resolved data, limited only by the amount of
acquisition memory in the hardware.
<P>
A new field, .RMAP has been added.  It is used only for internal bookkeeping.
