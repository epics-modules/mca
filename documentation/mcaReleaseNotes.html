    mca Release Notes</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-9 (23-Nov-2020)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Amptek driver
      <ul>
        <li>Support optional direct connection rather than broadcast search via command line
          argument to drvAmptekConfigure(). Thanks to Krisztian Loki for this.</li>
        <li>Broadcast to all network interfaces when searching for modules. Previously it
          only searched a single interface. Thanks to Hinko Kocevar for this. NOTE: this is
          implemented on both Linux and Windows. However, the current version has not yet
          been tested due to lack of access to hardware to test with.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added additional debugging output to the Canberra driver. Discovered that it is
      not possible to communicate with the Canberra AIM from 10 Gbit interface cards,
      even if the AIM is connected to a a 10/100/1000 Mbit switch. The reason for this
      is not clear. Most messages are sent and received fine, but some are not.</li>
    <li>Fix to allow building the Canberra driver on Centos 8 by undefining SOCKET when
      using libnet and libpcap.</li>
    <li>Added CI support using ci-script and Travis. Thanks to Benjamin Bradnick for this.</li>
    <li>Added OPI autoconvert files for CSS/Phoebus.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-8 (9-Aug-2019)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for a new InputPolarity record for the SIS3820. This allows selecting
      the polarity of the control inputs.</li>
    <li>Added OPI autoconvert files for edm, CSS BOY, and caQtDM.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-7 (8-Sept-2017)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for the Amptek DP5 based MCAs and detectors. It is <a href="mcaAmptek.html">
      documented here</a>.</li>
    <li>Moved the repository from Subversion at the APS to <a href="https://github.com/epics-modules/mca">
      github</a>.</li>
    <li>mcaRecord.dbd: Changed the data type of the preset count (PCT) field from DBF_LONG
      to DBF_DOUBLE. The value can reasonably be larger than an epicsInt32 will hold.
      devMcaAsyn.c and most drivers were already (incorrectly) treating the field as a
      double.</li>
    <li>Bruker QM100: Fixed the datatype of the mcaPresetCounts parameter.</li>
    <li>SIS3801 and SIS3820:
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed problems when the number of signals being used (maxSignals) was 32. In this
          case the left shift operator was shifting by 32-bits which is undefined, and could
          disable all channels rather than enabling all channels on some architectures.</li>
        <li>Changed the VME interrupt release method from the default RORA to ROAK for CPU
          boards that use the Tsi148 and rely on software initiated IACK cycles.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added .NUSE to simple_mca_settings.req.</li>
    <li>Minor change to allow building on mingw.</li>
    <li>Removed building mcaCanberra on cygwin-x86. WinPCAP libraries do not work with
      latest Cygwin version.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-6 (8-Dec-2014)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for SIS3820 firmware version 0x0111. This firmware provides control
      over the LNE pulse output signal:
      <ul>
        <li>Programmable pulse polarity, Normal and Inverted.</li>
        <li>Programmable pulse width, from 20 ns to 85.9 seconds in 20 ns increments. </li>
        <li>Programmable pulse delay, from 0 to 85.9 seconds in 20 ns increments. </li>
      </ul>
      Being able to program these pulse parameters means that the SIS3820 can now be used
      to directly trigger or gate most detectors without using external pulse inverter
      or pulse stretcher hardware. </li>
    <li>Added a function, sis3820_jtag_prom_epics() to load new firmware into the SIS3820
      over the VME bus rather than having to use a USB JTAG programmer. This function
      should work on vxWorks, RTEMS, and Linux, but it has only been tested on vxWorks.
      The latest version 0x0111 firmware file is included in the distribution or can be
      downloaded from the <a href="http://www.struck.de/sis3820firm.htm">SIS S8320 firmware
        Web site</a> </li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in the mcaRecord on some 64-bit architectures. The ROI calculations
      were incorrect because "long" was being used where epicsInt32 was needed.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-5 (27-June-2014)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed a serious bug in the Canberra support when libpcap was being used on Linux.
      Previously pcap_open_live was being called with a timeout of -1 (ms). This actually
      causes pcap to enter a tight polling loop where it uses 100% of the CPU time. The
      timeout was changed to 0, which means wait for a packet to arrive. The CPU time
      was reduced to 1%-2% for the test IOC, but the MCA and ICB performance (updates/sec,
      etc.) appears to be the same. Note that timeout of 0 does NOT work on Windows, and
      the previous value of -1 works fine, so the timeout was not changed on Windows or
      Cygwin.</li>
    <li>Minor changes to the Canberra support to work on Darwin. Darwin uses the BSD "bpf"
      library for raw packet reading. It requires setting the Ethernet interface into
      BIOCIMMEDIATE mode to receive packets immediately, and not have the OS buffer them.</li>
    <li>Minor bug fix for SIS38XX.cpp when stopping mca acquisition. Don't issue error
      if unit is in scaler mode and mcaStopAcquire is received as long as it is not acquiring.</li>
    <li>Previously the WinPcap DLL files were installed into the mca/bin/$(ARCH) directories.
      This does not work with Windows 7, because the DLLs that work on XP don't work on
      Windows 7. The DLLs are no longer distributed with mca. They were actually never
      needed because it was always necessary to install the WinPcap package to run an
      application built with Canberra support. This is because it requires drivers that
      were not distributed with mca. So the required DLLs will always be available on
      the target machine, and they are guaranteed to be the correct versions.</li>
    <li>Added support for the programmable high-voltage power supply in the Canberra DSA-2000.
      The MCA and DSP controls in the DSA-2000 were already supported. The file iocBoot/iocLinux/st_DSA2000.cmd
      is used to test this, and the mcaTest.adl medm screen can be used to load the new
      DSA2000_HVPS.adl screen.</li>
    <li>Cleaned up SIS38XX_SNL.st by removing unneeded empty strings in assign statements.</li>
    <li>Added new iocDarwin and iocWindows example directories, removed iocCygwin.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-4 (10-June-2013)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Changes to the Canberra support for vxWorks 6.x. These were done by Ron Sluiter.
      This vxWorks 6.x support requires that the Board Support Package (BSP) be built
      with the INCLUDE_NET_POOL option. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-3-1 (8-March-2013)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>mcaRecord
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a problem introduced in R7-2 with epicsTimeToStrftime format string. It
          would crash on Windows where %T is not a valid format item.</li>
        <li>Fixed a problem where the upper limit of the ROI (RnHI) was not limited to the
          number of elements in the MCA array, so the ROI calculation could be garbage or
          even crash.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>medm screens (mca.adl, simple_mca.adl). The ROI labels were incorrect, they were
      1-8, should be 0-7. These screens were also invoking mca_ROIs.adl incorrectly, they
      were invoking 1-N, rather than 0-(N-1). </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-3 (28-February-2013)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SIS38XX support
      <ul>
        <li>Renamed the InitialChannelAdvance record to CountOnStart, because this is really
          what it does. If this record is Yes (1) then the module begins counting input pulses
          as soon as acquisition is started. If this record is No (0) then the module does
          not begin counting input pulses until it receives the first External Channel Advance
          pulse. This record only applies in External Channel Advance mode.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug on the SIS3820 which caused the module not to begin counting input
          pulses when the InitialChannelAdvance record (now called CountOnStart) was Yes.
          The SIS3820 was doing a software channel advance, but was not being armed to count.
          This was not the desired behavior. The SIS3801 was behaving correctly, starting
          to count but not doing a channel advance. With this fix CountOnStart works identically
          on the SIS3820 and SIS3801. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>CanberraSupport
      <ul>
        <li>Changed Makefile to allow building on architectures like win32-x86-debug, win32-x86-dynamic,
          etc. and not just win32-x86. Same changes for windows-x64 and cygwin-x86.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-2 (6-September-2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>General
      <ul>
        <li>Minor changes to build with base 3.15</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SIS38XX support
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed the SISSrc/Makefile and vmeDMA.h so that by commenting out one line in the
          Makefile one can build on systems without Andrew Johnson's APS DMA support.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug in drvSIS3801.cpp. The bug was causing incorrect data in MCS mode
          under the following conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>The unit was previously counting in "scaler" mode.</li>
            <li>Acquisition was started in MCS mode with StartAll (rather than EraseStart) and
              without doing an EraseAll after the scaler mode acquisition was complete.</li>
          </ul>
          This change also fixes another problem. If MCS acquisition was stopped with StopAll
          and then resumed with StartAll there was one spuriously high count in each input
          channel. </li>
        <li>Fixed a bug in drvSIS38XX.cpp. If acquisition was already complete because CurrentChannel
          = NuseAll then processing StartAll was incorrectly causing acquisition to start
          again when it should not.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug in drvSIS3820.cpp. If acquisition was paused with StopAll and then
          resumed with StartAll the incorrect value was being programmed into the acquisition
          preset register. It should be NuseAll-CurrentChannel, but NuseAll was being programmed.
          This caused too many channels to be acquired, leading to buffer overflow and crashing
          the IOC.</li>
        <li>Fixed typo bug in drvSIS3820.cpp. clearScalerPresets was not clearing preset group
          1.</li>
        <li>Improved the logic for disabling AutoCount in the scaler record when starting
          MCS acquisition. The logic is still not perfect: if AutoCount is in progress when
          MCS acquisition is started it will set AutoCount to One-Shot but the AutoCount will
          complete and MCS acquisition will not really start. However, if MCS acquisition
          is started again it will succeed. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Canberra support
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug when using llc_sockets due to an uninitialized variable. Thanks to
          Jens Eden for finding and fixing this.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>drvFastSweep driver
      <ul>
        <li>Converted from C to C++ based on asynPortDriver. Should be backwards compatible
          with existing drivers and device support.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Databases
      <ul>
        <li>Added the R$(N)BG and R$(N)P fields for each ROI to simple_mca_settings.req. It
          was an oversight that these fields were not previously present.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-1 (2-November-2011)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SIS38XX support
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a serious bug when reading the FIFO on the SIS3820. For non-DMA reads it
          was previously using a call to memcpy(). This can cause bus errors because memcpy()
          is not guaranteed to do 32-bit word transfers, which the SIS3820 requires. In fact
          if the number of words to copy was exactly 1 then a bus error was ocurring, because
          memcpy() appears to do 4 8-bit transfers in this case.</li>
        <li>Added support to control the polarity of the control outputs on the SIS3820. Choices
          are Normal and Inverted.</li>
        <li>Added PINI=YES to Channel1Source and EnableClientWait records. Without this the
          initial channel 1 source was always internal until the record was forced to process.</li>
        <li>Fixed some bugs in SIS38XX drivers that happened on some systems that appear to
          be getting extra interrupts. Added additional asynTrace debugging to drivers to
          help track down this type of problem.</li>
        <li>Tracked down problem on the SIS3820 with too many counts in the first time bin
          in MCS mode when using External Channel Advance. This happens if there are pulses
          present on the first counter input. Apparently the unit is becoming enabled (i.e.
          counting) before the first external LNE pulse arrives. This is a bug in the SIS3820
          firmware. The workaround is to not have any hardware connection to the first counter
          input, and just use the internal 50MHz clock on this input. This problem is fixed
          in firmware release 0x010F, which is now available from SIS.</li>
        <li>Fixed bugs in the calls to devReadProbe in both the SIS3801 and SIS3820 drivers
          which were missing a needed "&" operator on the address to be probed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>mca record
      <ul>
        <li>The STIM field and the record time stamp were changed to record the time that
          acquisition <b>stopped</b> rather than the time that acquisition <b>started</b>.
          This was changed because in multi-element detector systems like the DXP xMAP or
          the SIS38XX MCS the MCA records only process when acquisition completes, not when
          it starts. In this situation the record time stamp and the STIM field were never
          being updated. The MCA record always processes when acquisition completes, so this
          field is now correctly updated, but has changed its meaning.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Minor fixes to medm adl files to make them work with the adl-BOY translator.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 7-0 (04-Aug-2011)</h2>
  <h3>
    SIS3801 and SIS320 multi-channel scaler support</h3>
  <p>
    The SIS3801 and SIS3820 support has been completely rewritten. In previous releases
    the driver was "synchronous", meaning that the MCA records blocked while the arrays
    were read from the FIFO on the VME modules. FIFO reads were done with VME program
    I/O, which can only do about 1000 32-bit words per ms. This was acceptable if the
    arrays were small (e.g. 2048 channels) because it only took a few ms to read each
    array. However, some users were beginning to use very large arrays (e.g. 2,000,000
    channels). In this case it took several seconds to read each array. Because the
    MCA records were synchronous, this blocked execution of other EPICS records and
    tasks while reading the hardware. This was unacceptable, leading to channel access
    disconnects and other bad effects.</p>
  <p>
    One way to fix this would be to make the drivers asynchronous, meaning that device
    support will do the I/O in a separate thread, and the records will not block. This
    is how other slow drivers for the MCA records work, for example the Canberra AIM
    and the XIA DXP modules. However, this approach cannot be used with the SIS drivers
    because they must support the EPICS "scaler" record, and the scaler record does
    not work properly with asynchronous device suppport.</p>
  <p>
    Instead, the drivers were rewritten so that the FIFO is read out into a driver buffer
    in a low-priority background thread. When the MCA records process they now just
    read the data from this driver buffer using a memcpy() call, which is very fast.
    Furthermore on the 3820 the driver now reads the FIFO using DMA over the VME bus.
    This yields a factor of 10 improvement in speed, over 40MB/s, compared to 4MB/s
    with program I/O.</p>
  <p>
    The new drivers have excellent performance with very large arrays, and arrays with
    more than 10 million elements can now be used if the VME CPU has sufficient memory.
    For example, a test was done with the following configuration:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SIS3820 module with 512MB of FIFO memory</li>
    <li>MVME 5100 CPU with 512MB of memory</li>
    <li>vxWorks 5.4.2 with Andrew Johnson's BSP with DMA support</li>
    <li>2 active inputs</li>
    <li>10,000,000 channels per waveform</li>
    <li>2 waveform records</li>
    <li>Internal channel advance</li>
    <li>1 microsecond dwell time</li>
    <li>ReadAll.SCAN = Passive</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The theoretical time for this acquisition to complete is 10 seconds. The following
    is the output from the EPICS "camonitor" program on a Linux client looking at the
    Acquiring PV, and the first 2 channels of each waveform record:</p>
  <pre>    >camonitor -tc -#2 SIS:3820:mca1 SIS:3820:mca2 SIS:3820:Acquiring 
    SIS:3820:Acquiring             (2011-05-01 11:19:35.050808) Acquiring 
    SIS:3820:mca1                  (2011-05-01 11:19:46.017134) 2 50 50 
    SIS:3820:mca2                  (2011-05-01 11:19:46.017223) 2 0 0 
    SIS:3820:Acquiring             (2011-05-01 11:19:46.017264) Done 
  </pre>
  <p>
    So the time between when acquisition started and when the client received the data
    and the Acquiring=Done status was 10.97 seconds. There is thus less than 1 second
    of overhead in collecting 2 waveforms of 10,000,000 elements each, which is 80MB
    of data.</p>
  <p>
    The following features have also been added to the drivers (thanks to Ulrik Pedersen
    from DLS for the initial implementation of several of these):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is no longer necessary to use the MCA record for the arrays. The standard EPICS
      waveform record can now be used instead if that is desired. The performance is somewhat
      better with the waveform record, because it has less overhead when it reads the
      arrays, not needing to perform ROI calculations, etc. The example startup scripts
      contain commands for both MCA and waveform records</li>
    <li>There is a new PV to perform a software channel advance. (Note that channel advance
      is called LNE in the SIS manuals). This PV can be processed at any time, and works
      in both internal and external channel advance modes.</li>
    <li>There is a new PV to control whether the driver does an initial software channel
      advance when acquisition is started, or whether the module does not start counting
      until the first internal or external channel advance signal arrives. Previously
      this option was only configurable in the startup script for the 3801, and was not
      available for the 3820 at all.</li>
    <li>There are new PVs to control the input and output modes. These control the functionality
      of the 4 input control signals and the 4 output control signals. They were previously
      only configurable in the startup script, while they can now be changed at run-time.</li>
    <li>There is a new PV to control the channel 1 source, i.e. whether it uses the internal
      clock (25MHz on 3801, 50MHz on 3820), or an external pulse input. This was previously
      only configurable in the startup script.</li>
    <li>There is a new PV to control the user-defined LED on the module, and on the 3820
      this is linked to a user-defineable binary output signal on a control output.</li>
    <li>There is a new PV to select which input is routed via the MUX to one of the output
      control signals on the 3820.</li>
    <li>There are new PVs that reflect the current acquisition mode (MCS or Scaler), the
      model number (3801 or 3820), and the firmware version.</li>
    <li>There is a new PV that displays the current channel number being acquired. This
      PV is I/O Intr scanned, and reflects the current value, whether or not the MCA or
      waveform records are being periodically processed during acquisition.</li>
    <li>The elapsed time PV is now also I/O Intr scanned, and reflects the current value,
      whether or not the MCA or waveform records are being periodically processed during
      acquisition.</li>
    <li>It is no longer necessary to periodically process the MCA records during acquisition
      to obtain status updates, so the StatusAll PV has been removed.</li>
    <li>The ReadAll PV can be periodically processed during acquisition to read the arrays
      into the MCA or waveform records. However, this is optional, and if this record
      is Passive then the arrays will still be read into these records as soon as acquisition
      completes. For highest performance with very large arrays this record should be
      Passive.</li>
    <li>In previous releases the database file (e.g. Struck32.db) contained the logic
      to process all of the MCA records when acquisition completed and to do other coordination
      tasks for the multiple MCA records. This required having multiple databases depending
      on how many MCA records (e.g. active inputs) were being used, and 8 and 32 input
      versions were included in the distribution. If an application demanded a different
      number of inputs (e.g. only 2 inputs with a very large number of channels) then
      the database needed to be customized. In the new release this logic is no longer
      in the database; rather it is contained in a very simple SNL program that must be
      run. This allows a single simple database to be used, no matter how many MCA or
      waveform records are being used.</li>
    <li>There is now logic in the database to disable Autocount mode in the scaler record
      when MCS data acquisition is started. This can prevent the interference that has
      been a problem in the past if Autocount started the scaler while MCS acquisition
      was in progress. However, this logic is not bullet-proof depending on exact timing,
      so it is still recommended to manually turn off autocount before starting MCS acquisition.</li>
    <li>The performance of the Erase operation has been significantly improved for large
      arrays. Previously the entire buffer, which could be many megabytes, was erased
      when any MCA record did the erase operation. This has been fixed so that it is only
      done once, and not 32 times if there are 32 MCA records.</li>

  <p>
    The driver is thus 10% smaller than in the previous release. This is because in
    the previous release the SIS3801/STR7201 support had device-specific device support
    for the scaler and MCA records (which were not based on asyn), and the SIS3820 driver
    used basic asyn support, rather than asynPortDriver. The new drivers USE the standard
    asyn device support for the scaler record (from the std module), the mca record
    (from the mca module), and the waveform record (from the asyn module), and there
    is no custom device support. Moreover, there is a base class, drvSIS38XX.cpp, which
    is implements the functions common to both the SIS3801 and the SIS3820. SIS38XX
    is derived from asynPortDriver, which handles much of the standard asyn code, and
    SIS3801.cpp and SIS3820.cpp are derived from SIS38XX.cpp.</p>
  <p>
    The SIS3801 and SIS3820 support in R7-0 is not backwards compatible with previous
    releases. IOC startup scripts must be changed, and the medm screens are different.
    However, the PVs that are used by most clients (such as the sscan record, SPEC and
    IDL), have not changed, so those clients should not need to be modified.</p>
  <h3>
    Canberra support</h3>
  <p>
    Added support for windows-x64 by including the 64-bit support files from WinPcap.</p>
  <h3>
    MCA record, MCA device support and MCA driver changes</h3>
  <p>
    Previously the MCA record sent the following messages (defined in mca.h) to device
    support:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>mcaChannelAdvanceInternal</li>
    <li>mcaChannelAdvanceExternal</li>
    <li>mcaModePHA</li>
    <li>mcaModeMCS</li>
    <li>mcaModeList</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Thus, it was sending a separate message for each type of channel advance and each
    type of acquisition mode. This was inconvenient for drivers and device support,
    and was not consistent with the way that other parameters were handled. This was
    thus changed to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>mcaChannelAdvanceSource</li>
    <li>mcaAcquireMode</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    where the value passed to device support in the message now specifies what type
    of channel advance source or acquisition mode is being requested. Similarly the
    strings defined in drvMca.h that are used by device support and drivers to define
    the asyn drvInfo value have had the same changes. The driver now receives a single
    command to change the acquire mode for example, and the value passed on the aysnInt32
    interface specifies which acquire mode is being requested. This makes the interface
    more extensible. All existing drivers in synApps have been modified to use the new
    interface.</p>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SIS3801
      <ul>
        <li>Bug fix. Was not returning the number of channels read in drvSTR7201Read, which

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>medm adl files
      <ul>
        <li>Added new simple_mca.adl, simple_mca_small.adl, and simple_mcaSetup.adl. These
          are like mca.adl, mca_small.adl and mcaSetup.adl except they only contain PVs that
          are in the mca record itself. They work with the simple_mca.db database, rather
          than the mca.db database. The simple_mca.db database is what is loaded for multi-channel
          systems like the SIS multichannel scalers and the DXP multielement detector systems.
          This change avoids the white fields in medm screens which were present when the
          non-simple adl screens were used with simple_mca.db.</li>
        <li>Added NORD to mcaSetup.adl.</li>
        <li>Modified Struck8.adl and Struck32.adl to use the simple_mca screens. Also added
          mca1.NMAX and mca1.NORD to these screens so the maximum number of channels and the

  <ul>
    <li>drvMcaSIS3820Asyn.c
      <ul>
        <li>Bug fix. The callback to scaler record device support was passing a value of 0
          when acquisition completes, but it must pass 1. This caused the scaler record to
          hang in the "counting" state after the preset was reached.</li>
      </ul>

          change is needed for areaDetector R1-6.</li>
      </ul>

  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 6-12 (10-May-2010)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>General
      <ul>
        <li>Changed device support (devMcaAsyn) so that it no longer uses enum values for
          pasynUser->reason. Rather, it uses asynDrvUser->create to fetch pasynUser->reason
          from the drvInfo strings published in drvMca.h. This change allows MCA drivers to
          implement the mca commands in addition to other commands, because fixed (and potentially
          conflicting) enum values are no longer used. All mca drivers were rewritten to make
          the association of drvInfo strings with pasynUser->reason values private to the
          drivers.</li>
        <li>Fixes for 64-bit compatibility.</li>
        <li>Fixes for EPICS R3.14.11 compatibility.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Canberra driver
      <ul>
        <li>Added support for win32-x86 using WinPcap.</li>
        <li>Converted Cygwin support from using both WinPcap (to receive packets) and libnet
          (to send packets) to using just WinPcap, which can actually do both send and receive.
          WinPcap is also win32-x86 compatible, while libnet is not.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SIS 3820 driver
      <ul>
        <li>Allow inputMode and outputMode to have any values from 0 to 15 in mcaSIS3820Config
          command. Previously inputMode was limited to 0 to 5, and outputMode from 0 to 2.
          The previous version thus did not allow inputMode=6 or outputMode=3. It also did
          not allow setting the most significant bit of these 4-bit groups, which inverts
          the polarity of the signals.</li>
        <li>Deleted obsolete files that were left over from time when MCA and scaler drivers
          for SIS 3820 were separate. They have been combined into a single driver for a long
          time, but the old files were still present, which was confusing.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SIS 3801/STR7201 driver
      <ul>
        <li>Renamed mcaSISSupport.dbd to mcaSTR7201Support.dbd to avoid confusion with SIS
          3820. This will require changes in applications that include this file. Renamed
          mcaSISRegister.c to mcaSTR7201Register.c, also to avoid confusion.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Db
      <ul>
        <li>Defined strings for ZNAM and ONAM fields of bo records in *element*.db, Struck*.db,
          and mca.db, so that its possible for a sseq record to write to these fields.</li>
        <li>Added new database, mcaReadNotify.db, a modified copy of mca.db. mcaReadNotify
          contains an additional record, $(P)$(M)ReadNotify, by which the user can write to
          $(P)$(M).READ, causing a data read. If $(P)$(M)ReadNotify is written to by a ca_put_callback,
          the callback will not come until the mca record has posted its VAL field. This permits
          the user to detect read completion while the mca is still acquiring.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 6-11 (2-Feb-2009)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>CanberraSrc
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug in AIM communication on 68040 processors due to structure size being
          reported wrong by sizeof() from compiler. This had been fixed long ago, but the
          fix was lost in the conversion to LLC sockets.</li>

        <li>Force build to install Libnet and wpcap before building mcaAim.exe</li>
        <li>icb_user_subs.c: atoi -> strtol</li>
        <li>nmc_comm_subs_1.c: include if_arp.h only if USE_SOCKETS</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>SIS3820
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug introduced in asyn R4-9. The problem was deadlock when acquisition
          completed and the ReadAll or StatusAll records were being periodically scanned.
          The solution was to take the ReadCallback record out of the same lockset as the
          ReadAll record. This was done by changing the FLNK in the ReadCallback record from
          PP to CA.</li>
        <li>Added mcaApp/Db/Struck_settings.req to save settings for top-level records in
          Struck8.db and Struck32.db.</li>
        <li>Fixed problems with autosave in iocBoot/iocVxWorks/.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>RontecSrc
      <ul>
        <li>New driver which uses the high-speed Bruker Megalink PC card, rather than the
          serial interface. This driver was written by Jens Eden from PTB in Germany. This
          driver has the following advantages:
          <ul>
            <li>Using the Bruker megalink PC-card is much faster than the serial interface</li>
            <li>It works around the problem that the newer SVE III controller models don't accept
              the RCL command $LS (elapsed life-time) and the livetime-presets any more. </li>
            <li>Allows the Bruker GUI to run in parallel.</li>
          </ul>
          The drawback is that it compiles and runs on Windows only. You need to install the
          Bruker QM100 Software and the Bruker Esprit API which contains the RTIfcServer.dll
          to be able to use it.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>mcaSrc/drvFastSweep.c
      <ul>
        <li>Changed so that drvUser strings for the data and time interval are no longer hardcoded
          to be DATA and SCAN_PERIOD. These strings are now parameters to the initFastSweep
          command. But they default to DATA and SCAN_PERIOD for backwards compatibility.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Modified to depend on busy module, instead of sscan module for busy record.</li>
    <li>Added directory dependencies, to support multi-job build (gnumake -j)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 6-10 (December 21, 2007)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>mcaSrc
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug in MCA record. The record must force a read of the data whenever acquisition
          completes (.ACQG=1 changes to .ACQG=0). In earlier versions it could miss this transition
          if acquisition was complete by the time of the first status poll. The bug fix in
          R6-9 attempted to fix this, but it was inefficient and not completely effective.
          The new fix is for the record to force .ACQG=1 whenever acquisition is started,
          and not rely on the poll to set .ACQG to 1.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>CanberraSrc
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the code to read data from the new AIM modules (556A, DSA2000) in uncompressed
          mode. This improves the performance by about a factor of 3 over the previous code
          which used compressed mode for all AIM models. These newer models are very slow
          to compress the data because they lack a co-processor. The older 556 modules are
          still read in compressed format, because it is faster. With this change the time
          to acquire spectra quickly from the 556 and 556A is virtually identical.</li>
        <li>Added code to use LLC sockets on vxWorks (rather than etherLib) and Linux (rather
          than libnet and libpcap). Thanks to Peter Denision of DLS for the initial version
          of this code. This change is needed for vxWorks 5.5, because the older etherHook
          functions are no longer supported. It is also useful on Linux because the IOC application
          does not need to be run as root.<br />
          The vxWorks code must be built with muxLib on vxWorks 5.4.2 and earlier, and muxTkLib
          on vxWorks 5.5 and later. muxTkLib does not work correctly on vxWorks 5.4.2, it
          kills all other protocols when muxTkBind is called with MUX_PROTO_SNARF. muxTkLib
          versus muxLib is selected via the flag USE_MUXTKLIB in CanberraSrc/Makefile.
          <br />
          Note that AIMConfig automatically registers and attaches to the LLC protocol driver,
          unlike in the original version from Diamond.<br />
          On Linux the new LLC code is selected by configuring USE_SOCKETS in CanberraSrc/Makefile.
          This can only be used on Linux kernel versions 2.6.14 and later. Earlier versions
          do not support LLC sockets correctly.</li>

    <li>Fixed bug with data type of mcaPresetCounts in devMcaAsyn.c</li>
    <li>Fixed bug in mcaRecord.c. Need to force a read of the data when acquisition is
      turned on. Without it a device that is done acquiring by the time the status is
      read for the first time will never get the data read (because Read record in database

  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 6-7 (July 10, 2006)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed timing bug in communication between record and device support. In previous
      releases device support was setting the .ACQG field to 0 (Done) before the final
      read of the device was complete. This meant that channel access clients that were
      doing cagets() of .ACQG to see when acquisition was complete and then reading data
      immediately could get incorrect data. Note that this problem did not occur if clients
      were using monitors (callbacks), because the record did not call dbPostEvents until
      the final read of data from the device was complete.
      <br />
      The fix to this problem required re-writing the interface between the record and
      device support so that device support does not directly modify the .ACQG field.
      Rather it now passes a structure with status information which the record uses to
      modify the record fields, and it does not set the .ACQG field until the record contains
      the latest data.
      <br />
      The record support, asyn device support (for all devices except Struck), and the
      Struck (SIS) device support were all modified.</li>
    <li>mcaRecord
      <ul>
        <li>Converted all DBF_FLOAT record fields to DBF_DOUBLE.</li>
        <li>Added the PSTATUS (private) field for status buffer.</li>
        <li>Removed the ACQP, DWLP, ERTP, ELTP and ACTP (private) fields which are no longer
          needed because PSTATUS field replaces them.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Removed macro definitions with variable arguments (e.q. Debug) for portability.</li>

  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 6-6 (November 16, 2005)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added mcaApp/RontecSrc directory with support for the Rontec XFlash MCA. This
      works with any serial port with asyn support.</li>
    <li>Added support for Canberra AIM on Windows IOCs (using Cygwin).</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in mcaRecord. If a channel access put should have caused the record
      to process again because it was busy (.RPRO field=1) it was not processing again
      because the record only calls recGblFwdLink when acquisition completes. Work around
      problem by checking RPRO at end of record processing and repeating processing loop
      if RPRO=1 and acquisition is not complete.</li>
    <li>Fixed occasional timing problem with Canberra AIM on Linux not receiving first
      inquiry response.</li>
    <li>Fixed problems with the iocLinux and iocVxWorks example IOCs.</li>
    <li>Added iocRontec example IOC.</li>
    <li>Added iocCygwin example IOC for Canberra on Cygwin.</li>

    <li>Improved the documentation in mcaDoc.html and mcaRecord.html.</li>
    <li>Added the acquiring (.ACQG) field to 16element_time.adl.</li>
    <li>Things planned for future release:
      <ul>
        <li>Add a calibrated X axis PV, so one can plot spectra versus energy in medm</li>
        <li>Add ROI low and high PVs in calibrated units, so that users can define ROIs in
          calibrated unit (e.g. energy), and copy ROIs from one MCA to another in these calibrated
          units.</li>
        <li>Add medm screen shots to the mcaDoc, mcaCanberra, and mcaStruck html files.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 6-5 (March 29, 2005)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Changed behavior on the SIS (Struck) MCS with software_next. In release 6-4 we
      never do a software channel advance ("software Next") when starting acquire in MCS
      mode with external channel advance. This has the side effect, documented in the
      6-4 release notes, that it takes one extra external pulse to arm the system, so
      the unit does not count at all until the first external pulse arrives, and it takes
      N+1 pulses before it gets to channel 2.
      <br />
      There is thus a trade-off. If the software does not issue a channel advance then
      it takes one external pulse to start the system counting. If the software does issue
      a channel advance, then the module starts counting immediately, which leads to "hot"
      first pixels.
      <br />
      It was decided to make the behavior be configurable in the startup script, so that
      users can choose the behavior that best meets their needs. An additional argument
      was added to the STR7201Config command. The new syntax is:
      <pre>      # STR7201Config(int card, int maxSignals, int maxChans,
      #               int 1=enable internal 25MHZ clock,
      #               int 1=enable initial software channel advance in MCS external advance mode)
      </pre>
      By setting the last argument to 1 a software channel advance will be issued when
      acquisition starts. Setting the argument to 0 or omitting it will lead to no software
      channel advance.</li>
    <li>Fixed several bugs in the Canberra ICB support, mostly dereferencing null pointers,
      found in Linux testing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 6-4 (March 24, 2005)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Converted from mpf to asyn for device and driver support. This was a major re-write
      of the mca device support, as well as all drivers.</li>
    <li>Changed debugging to use asynTrace facility except for mcaRecord.</li>
    <li>Converted device support from C++ to C.</li>
    <li>Changed thread creation to use generic stack sizes, not absolute.</li>
    <li>Canberra AIM support on Linux is no longer built by default, for those who do
      not have libnet and libpcap. Must edit CanberraSrc/Makefile to build it.</li>
    <li>Changed device support for Canberra ICB modules to use generic asyn device support.</li>
    <li>Fixed problems on the SIS (Struck) MCS with software_next. In the previous version
      we always did a software_next when starting acquire. This had the following problems:
      <ul>
        <li>In external channel advance mode the first dwell period was always a single pulse,
          even if prescale was > 1.</li>
        <li>When using the EPICS scaler record it counted for .01 seconds longer than requested.</li>
        <li>The scaler started counting immediately in external channel advance mode, leading
          to "hot" first pixels.</li>
      </ul>
      Now we only do software_next for old firmware, or for internal channel advance mode
      in MCS (not scaler) mode. The new side-effect is that it takes one extra external
      pulse to arm the system. The unit does not count at all until the first external
      pulse arrives, and it takes N+1 pulses before it gets to channel 2. We still give
      software_next in internal channel advance MCS mode, because otherwise it misses
      one entire dwell period at the beginning.</li>

      to initialize hardware, rather than doing it in connectIO in device support. This
      was made possible in version MPF version 1-8 which allows waiting for the MPF server
      to connect and sending messages before iocInit is complete. This is much cleaner,
      since device support no longer needs to know details about the records.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 5.02 (January 11, 2001)</h2>
  <p>
    This new release has the following enhancements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This release completes the conversion to MPF of all software which communicates
      with the AIM. All of the Instrument Control Bus (ICB) modules now communicate via
      MPF. The ICB software includes the following enhancements:
      <ul>
        <li>Improved support is provided for the ADC (9633 and 9635), amplifier (9615), high-voltage
          power-supply (HVPS) (9641, 9645) and the amp/three-channel analyzer (TCA) (2016)
          modules. Previously the support for these modules used the EPICS subroutine record.
          This was very restrictive, since it limited the number of parameters which could
          be controlled, and more importantly prevented the use of normal EPICS menus and
          graphical limits on analog values. The new support uses standard EPICS records (ao,
          mbbo, ai, mbbi), removing these restrictions. All of the software for the ICB devices
          has been replaced (source code, databases and medm display files). The database
          and medm files have the same names to simplify the transition, but significant changes
          are required to the vxWorks startup files. The changes are described below.</li>
        <li>The previous support was synchronous, which meant that EPICS scan tasks waited
          while sometimes lengthy communications took place between the IOC and the AIM. This
          was not good EPICS programming practice. The new device support is asynchronous,
          as it should be.</li>
        <li>Bugs in the TCA device support have been fixed. The TCA device support now works
          with the MCA record to automatically program the TCA windows to the energies of
          the first three ROIs, which is very simple and convenient.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Device support is now provided to use the SIS 380x multiscaler with the EPICS
      scaler record, in addition to the previous support for the EPICS MCA record. This
      means that it is no longer necessary to install a Joerger scaler in an IOCs which
      has an SIS scaler installed. The only limitation of this device support is that
      the SIS cannot actually count for a preset time or a preset number of counts on
      a channel. Thus, the presets are handled in software, and the actual count time
      will be &lt;=0.01 second greater than requested. The actual count time is very accurate,
      it is just not exactly what was requested. As part of this support it is now possible
      to enable the 25 MHz internal clock on the first scaler input channel. This is done
      by adding an additional parameter to STR7201Config(). This internal clock can be
      used to count for a preset time without need for an external clock. It is possible
      to use the SIS 380x as both an MCA and as a simple scaler without rebooting the
      IOC. The only restriction is that it cannot be acquiring in both modes simultaneously,
      i.e. scaler counting must complete before starting MCA acquisition and visa-versa.</li>
    <li>Databases and medm screens are now provided for 8-channel and 32-channel versions
      of the SIS 380x multiscaler with the MCA record. These screens control all channels
      of the SIS simultaneously, but allow for displaying combined or individual spectra.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 style="text-align: center">
    ICB source code organization</h3>
  <p>
    The device support for the ICB modules is provided in four main files:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>devIcbMpf.cc This file provides support for the ao, mbbo, ai and mbbi records
      for all ICB modules. It knows nothing about any specific module, it simply passes
      messages to MPF with a parameter code and value.</li>
    <li>icbServer.cc This is the MPF server software for the ADC, amplifier and HVPS.</li>
    <li>icbTcaServer.cc This is the MPF server software for the TCA.</li>
    <li>icbDspServer.cc This is the MPF server software for the 9660 digital signal processor
      (DSP)</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Each of the MPF servers can control any number of ICB modules of the specified type.
    Thus, a single icbServer can control any number of ADCs, amplifiers and HVPS units,
    a single icbTcaServer can control any number of TCA modules, etc. On the other hand
    it is also possible to use multiple MPF servers when talking to multiple ICB modules
    of the same family. The decision as to when to use more than one MPF servers is
    one of performance. This decision is made in the initialization commands in the
    vxWorks startup file. Each MPF server is synchronous, meaning that it must wait
    for a reply from the AIM before processing the next message. When using multiple
    AIMs, for example with a multi-element detector, it can make sense to use multiple
    MPF ICB servers so that some communication can be done in parallel. On the other
    hand, the ICB communications are typically low bandwidth and a single MPF server
    will often suffice.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center">

  <p>
    The following lines must be added to the vxWorks startup file. Note that the lines

    Release 5.01 - October 3, 2000</h2>
  <p>
    The Struck STR7201/SIS 380x device support for the scaler record is improved so
    that acquisition terminates within 0.01 seconds of the preset time. The device support
    for the MCA record and scaler record are now compatible, so that it is possible
    to have scaler and MCA records which communicate with the device loaded in the IOC
    simultaneously. The only restriction is that the only one record type or the other
    should be communicating with the hardware at any one time. The Struck8.db database
    was modified so that presets work correctly.</p>
  <p>
    A serious bug was fixed in drvSTR7201.c. Previously it was possible for multiple
    vxWorks tasks, including the interrupt handler, to be talking to the hardware simultaneously.
    This could cause bus errors when reading the FIFO and other nasty problems. A semaphore
    was added and interrupts were disabled at appropriate times to prevent such conflicts.</p>
  <p>
    Changed the task priority of the nmc_status_dispatch and nmc_inquiry tasks in nmc_comm_subs_1.c
    to 100 from 50, so that they would be lower priority than tnetTask.</p>
  <p>
    Added support for the Canberra 9660 DSP module. This module uses the devIcbMpf device
    support (same as the AIM MCA device support) and an MPF server, icbDspServer.cc.
    The device support uses standard EPICS records (ao, mbbo, ai, mbbi).</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 5.0 - September 9, 2000</h2>
  <p>
    This release of mcaApp is intended primarily to improve performance with the Canberra
    AIM MCA hardware. The main enhancements are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        To make the low-level AIM support routines able to send commands to multiple AIMs
        in parallel, i.e. without waiting for the response from one AIM before sending a
        command to another. This is necessary to improve the performance of systems with
        multiple AIMs being used for multi-element detectors.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To make the device support for the AIM be "asynchronous". In previous versions the
        AIM device support was "synchronous", meaning that the MCA record waited for a response
        from the AIM before returning. Since the AIM can take 50-100 msec to respond to
        some commands, this was poor EPICS programming practice. It would cause the EPICS
        scan tasks to wait for extended periods of time, particularly if many MCA records
        were being used.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To improve the performance of the AIM device support when used with multiplexors,
        i.e. multiple MCA records per AIM ADC port.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To modify the multi-element detector databases to process MCA records in parallel,
        taking advantage of changes 1) and 2) above.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    One result of these changes is that the overhead with multielement detector systems
    will be reduced proportionally by the number of AIMs in the system, e.g. a system
    with 4 AIMs should have 4 times less overhead than in previous versions. The overhead
    time to collect 13 spectra of 2048 channels from a detector with 4 AIMs should now
    be about 0.25 seconds.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center">
    Low level AIM support changes</h3>
  <p>
    In the previous versions of the low-level AIM routines (nmc_comm_subs_1.c, nmc_comm_subs_2.c)
    there was a single system-wide interlock and message response queue for AIM communication.
    Once a message was sent to any AIM no further messages could be sent to any AIM
    until the response from the first AIM was received. This was a serious performance
    limitation when communicating with multiple AIMs. It is much more efficient to have
    separate interlocks and message response queues for each AIM, rather than a single
    one per IOC. The low-level AIM routines were re-written to implement this more efficient
    model which permits simultaneous communication with multiple AIM modules.</p>
  <h3 style="text-align: center">
    MCA record device support changes for the AIM</h3>
  <p>
    Previous versions the AIM device support was "synchronous", meaning that the MCA
    record waited for a response from the AIM before returning. Since the AIM can take
    50-100 msec to respond to some commands, this was poor EPICS programming practice.
    It would cause the EPICS scan tasks to wait for extended periods of time, particularly
    if many MCA records were being used. However, the low-level AIM routines are necessarily
    synchronous since multiple transactions with the AIM can be required to implement
    a single high-level function (e.g. "erase").</p>
  <p>
    What is needed, therefore, is a separate vxWorks task for each AIM or AIM port.
    The record should call the AIM device support, which in turn sends a message to
    the appropriate task and then returns immediately. The task communicates synchronously
    with the AIM, and then issues a callback to record support when the AIM communication
    is complete.</p>
  <p>
    The solution to this problem turned out to be quite simple, since this is exactly
    what the Message Passing Facility, MPF is intended to do. In fact there was already
    MPF device support for the MCA record for the Acromag IP330 ADC when used as a waveform
    digitizer. All that needed to be done was to take this device support (devMcaIp330.cc)
    and convert it to a general MCA device support interface. This layer does not need
    to know anything about the particular MCA device, its role is simply to pass messages
    from the MCA record to an MPF server. The new file devMcaMpf.cc implements this
    device-independent layer. All of the device dependent code is now in the specific
    MPF server.</p>
  <p>
    For the Acromag IP330 ADC the existing Ip330SweepServer.cc was rewritten slightly
    to handle the more general messages from devMcaMpf.cc. Ip330Sweep.cc was rewritten
    slightly to handle live-time as well as real-time messages. This new version of
    ip330App must be used when upgrading to this release of mcaApp.
  </p>
  <p>
    A new MPF server, mcaAIMServer.cc was written to communicate with AIM modules. There
    is one such server per AIM ADC port, e.g. up to two servers per AIM. This server
    is basically just a rewrite of the code which was previously in devMCA_AIM.c. The
    flow of control for communication with the AIM is now:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        mcaRecord processes, calling a function in devMcaMpf</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        devMcaMpf sends a message to mcaAIMServer and returns to immediately to mcaRecord.
        mcaRecord returns immediately to EPICS.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        mcaAIMServer, which runs as a separate vxWorks task, sends one or more messages
        to the AIM and waits for the replies.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        When the replies are all received mcaAIMServer sends a message back to devMcaMpf.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        devmcaMpf issues a callback to mcaRecord, which calls devMcaMpf again to complete
        the operation.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This scheme properly implements asynchronous record processing, so that AIM communication
    no longer causes the EPICS scan tasks to wait.</p>
  <p>
    mcaAIMServer.cc implements several optimizations to improve performance when used
    with multiplexors, typically used with multielement detectors. When a multiplexor
    is used there are multiple "signals" on a single AIM ADC port or mcaAIMServer. The
    following optimizations are now implemented:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        If an Erase command is sent for signal 0 then the AIM memory for <b>all</b> of the
        signals is erased. This is done in a single message to the AIM. This is significantly
        faster than sending multiple messages to erase smaller blocks of AIM memory. Multielement
        detector databases take advantage of this optimization by only sending Erase commands
        for the <b>first</b> signal (0) on each port. It is not necessary to send erase
        commands for the other signals, because the memory will be erased when signal 0
        is erased. The elapsed real time, elapsed live time and elapsed total counts are
        common to all signals on each port, and these will also be reset when an erase is
        sent to signal 0.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The results of Read Status commands (elapsed live time, elapsed real time, elapsed
        total counts, and acquiring status) are cached in the mcaAIMServer object. If a
        Read Status command is received by mcaAIMServer then this will result in a network
        message being sent to the AIM only if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The Read Status command is for signal 0</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The time since the most recent Read Status command was sent to the AIM is more than
            0.1 seconds</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This optimization results in significantly fewer network messages being sent to
        the AIM, since the status for all signals is typically read in rapid succession,
        and the cached value will generally be used for all but signal 0.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Struck/SIS Driver Changes</h3>
  <p>
    There was a problem in previous versions of drvSTR7201.c for the prescale feature
    of the SIS 380x. The internal prescale counter was not correctly reset when the
    prescale value was changed. This could be a serious problem when changing from a
    large prescale value to a small prescale value, since the first dwell period after
    the change could require many more channel advance pulses (internal or external)
    than it should. SIS has provided additional information on how to properly program
    the prescaler, and the problem is now fixed.</p>
  <h3>
    MCA record changes</h3>
  <p>
    A new field, .ERST (ERase/STart) was added to the mcaRecord. Writing a 1 to this
    field causes the record to execute an Erase and a Start in a single operation, rather
    than the two operations required if the .ERAS and .STRT fields are written to separately.
    Adding this field has two beneficial effects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It significantly simplifies the databases (mca.db, 16element.db, etc.) because
      the logic for Erase/Start is now very simple.</li>
    <li>It significantly improves performance because it saves a Read Status call to device
      support, which in the case of the AIM would require a network message to the AIM.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The <code>init_record </code>routine was changed to set flags which cause all of
    fields of interest to device support (.PRTM, .PLTM, .NUSE, etc.) to be sent to device
    support the first time the record processes. In principle all databases which create
    MCA records should now set PINI="YES" so that the MCA record processes once at iocInit
    and all of these values are sent to device support at that time. <i>However</i>
    this does <i>not work</i> for MPF devices yet (AIM, IP330) because at record initialization
    the MPF server has typically not yet connected and it gets the message passing out
    of sync if PINI is YES. For now we do not set PINI=YES in the MCA databases. The
    MPF device support synchronizes the device with the record when the MPF server connects.
    Furthermore the record will synchronize again the first time the record processes.</p>
  <p>
    A logic bug was fixed which caused the record to misbehave if the .READ field was
    set while a Read callback was pending.</p>
  <h3>
    Database Changes</h3>
  <p>
    mca.db was simplified with the removal of a fanout and swait record because EraseStart
    now uses the .ERST field in the MCA record. The current version is mca_5.3.db.</p>
  <p>
    16element.db was modified as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>EraseStart now uses the .ERST field of the record and only processes the records
      with signal=0. It no longer links to StartAll and EraseAll.</li>
    <li>All fanout links were changed from PP to CA links. This is necessary to get EPICS
      to processes the linked records in "parallel" rather than waiting for each one to
      complete before starting the next.</li>
    <li>A new Busy record, AcquireBusy, was added. This record is needed for the scan
      record to work correctly now that the fanout outputs are CA rather than PP. This
      record is set to 1 when StartAll or EraseStart is set to 1, and is cleared when
      Acquiring makes a transition from 1 to 0.</li>
    <li>The Acquiring record was changed to look at the acquire status of all 16 MCAs,
      rather than just the 4 MCAs with signal=0. The reason for this is that it is possible
      that the records with signal=0 will all finish and set .ACQG=0 before some record
      with signal!=0 has set .ACQG=0. The record is only guaranteed to read the data from
      the AIM when it sets .ACQG=0, and thus some records might not have read their data
      yet if they are not involved in the Acquiring calculation. When the Acquiring record
      makes a transition from 1 to 0 it now clears the AcquireBusy record as well as processing
      the StopScaler record.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A new database, simple_mca.db was created. It replaces simple_mca_aim.db and simple_mca_struck.db.
    Template files which call simple_mca.db must now pass DTYP, INP, and PREC.</p>
  <h3>
    Building applications</h3>
  <p>
    Because the AIM device support now requires MPF there are some changes required
    in building applications which use the AIM. When building an application directory
    &lt;myApp&gt;/src in the past it was only necessary to include in Makefile.Vx the
    lines:</p>
  <pre>include $(SHARE)/mcaApp/src/mcaLIBOBJS
LIBOBJS += $(MCALIBOBJS)</pre>
  <p>
    and in &lt;APP&gt;Include.dbd the line</p>
  <pre>include "mcaShare.dbd"</pre>
  <p>
    Because MPF can pass messages across the network, including across the backplane
    to an auxilliary CPU, the user has choices as to where to actually run the mcaAIMServer
    MPF server. I recommend running it locally on the same CPU which is running the
    EPICS MCA record, since this will minimize the MPF communications overhead. In this
    case it is necessary to load the basic MPF server code and the mcaAimServer code
    onto this CPU. This may not be currently happening if the IOC is set up to run the
    MPF server code only on an auxilliary CPU. The solution I recommend is to build
    a separate MPF server library in &lt;myApp&gt;/src by adding the following lines
    to Makefile.Vx</p>
  <pre>include $(SHARE)/ipApp/src/mpfServerLIBOBJS
include $(SHARE)/mcaApp/src/mpfServerLIBOBJS

#----------------------------------------
# ADD RULES AFTER THIS LINE
mpfServLib: $(MPFSERVERLIBOBJS)
$(LINK.c) $@ $(MPFSERVERLIBOBJS)</pre>
  <p>
    This works by looking at the files ipApp/mpfServerLIBOBJS and mcaApp/mpfServerLIBOBJS
    to make a list of all the object files required to build mpfServerLib. Users may
    need to get the latest version of ipApp from Tim Mooney in order to get mpfServerLIBOBJS.
    If mpfServerLib is built this way and is loaded on a CPU which does not have IP
    slots (e.g. MV167 or PPC) then there is some unused code, but the memory cost is
    not large.</p>
  <p>
    There is a problem with the current version of DevMpf.cc in the MPF distribution.
    DevMpf prevents a record from sending multiple messages to device support during
    one record processing. This problem will be fixed in the next release of MPF. Meanwhile
    in order for the MCA record to work with MPF the following lines must be <strong>deleted</strong>
    from DevMpf::read_write in DevMpf.cc.</p>
  <pre>if(pcommon-&gt;pact==TRUE &amp;&amp; pdevMpf-&gt;replyMessage==0) {
  if(DevMpfDebug) epicsPrintf("%s PACT true and no reply message\n");
  recGblSetSevr(pcommon,COMM_ALARM,INVALID_ALARM);
  return(MPF_NoConvert);
}
</pre>
  <h3>
    vxWorks Startup File</h3>
  <p>
    The vxWorks startup file must be changed to use the new AIM device support code.</p>
  <p>
    The following lines should be added near the beginning, after loading iocCore and
    all of your other support libraries:</p>
  <pre># Initialize local MPF connection
ld &lt; mpfServLib
routerInit
localMessageRouterStart(0)
</pre>
  <p>
    Note that some or all of these lines may already exist in your startup file, depending
    upon whether you are currently running MPF at all, and/or are running a local MPF
    server.</p>
  <p>
    The following lines show the global variables to turn on debugging at various levels.
    aimDebug turns on debugging for the low level AIM routines, etc. Setting these flags
    to higher numbers (1-10) turns on increasingly more verbose debugging messages.</p>
  <pre>mcaRecordDebug = 0
devMcaMpfDebug = 0
mcaAIMServerDebug = 0
aimDebug = 0</pre>
  <p>
    The AIMSetup() command which was previously used to indicate the maximum number
    of AIMs in a system is no longer used. Allocation of structures for each AIM now
    happens in AIMConfig when the mcaAIMServer object is created.</p>
  <p>
    The format of the AIMConfig() command has changed. The syntax is now:</p>
  <pre>### AIMConfig(serverName, ethernetAddress, port, maxChans, maxSignals,
### maxSequences, ethernetDevice, queueSize)
AIMConfig("AIM1/1", 0x6E6, 1, 2048, 1, 1, "ei0", 100)
AIMConfig("AIM1/2", 0x6E6, 2, 2048, 4, 1, "ei0", 100)
</pre>
  <p>
    <code>serverName</code>, the MPF server name, is arbitrary, it just must be the
    same in the AIMConfig and dbLoadRecords commands. The name of the vxWorks task will
    be the name of the MPF server with the letter "t" in front of it, e.g. <code>tAIM1/1</code>
    in this case.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>ethernetAddress</code> is the low order 16 bits of the AIM Ethernet address,
    which is printed on the front of the AIM.</p>
  <p>
    <code>port</code> is the AIM ADC port for this server, 1 or 2.</p>
  <p>
    <code>maxChans, maxSignals </code>and <code>maxSequences</code> are the maximum
    number of channels, signals (used for multiplexors and Canberra MCS units) and sequences
    (used for time-resolved spectroscopy). The amount of memory required in the AIM
    is <code>maxChans*maxSignals*maxSequences*4 </code>bytes.</p>
  <p>
    <code>ethernetDevice</code> is the name of the vxWorks Ethernet device for the network
    with this AIM. This is typically "ei0" for the Motorola 68K CPUs and "dc0" for the
    Motorola PowerPC CPUs.</p>
  <p>
    <code>queueSize</code> is the size of the MPF message queue for this server. 100
    should be plenty.</p>
  <p>
    The format of the dbLoadRecords command has also changed:</p>
  <pre>dbLoadRecords("share/mcaApp/Db/mca.db", "P=13IDC:,M=aim_adc1,DTYPE=MPF MCA,INP=#C0 S0 @AIM1/1,NCHAN=2048")
dbLoadRecords("share/mcaApp/Db/mca.db", "P=13IDC:,M=aim_mcs1,DTYPE=MPF MCA,INP=#C0 S0 @AIM1/2,NCHAN=2048")
</pre>
  <p>
    The DTYPE field is now "MPF MCA" rather than "Canberra AIM MCA". The "card" (#Cn)
    is now the identification number of the MPF server (e.g. 0=local MPF server, 1=remote
    MPF server) rather than a number specific to each AIM. The parm field is now @serverName
    to specify the MPF server for this AIM.</p>
  <p>
    Example multielement template file and command file.</p>
  <p>
    The following is an example of a vxWorks command file script to load everything
    for the GSECARS 16 element detector which uses 2 AIMs with multiplexors. This file
    is invoked with "&lt;16element.cmd".</p>
  <pre># AIMConfig(mpfServer, ethernet_address, port, maxChans,
# maxSignals, maxSequences, ethernetDevice, queueSize)
AIMConfig("AIM1/1", 0x8d7, 1, 4096, 4, 1, "ei0", 100)
AIMConfig("AIM1/2", 0x8d7, 2, 4096, 4, 1, "ei0", 100)
AIMConfig("AIM2/1", 0x3ec, 1, 4096, 4, 1, "ei0", 100)
AIMConfig("AIM2/2", 0x3ec, 2, 4096, 4, 1, "ei0", 100)

  <p>
    drvSTR7201.c for the Struck 7201 and SIS 380x had some serious problems:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Things were not initialized to zero, and this could cause problems. </li>
    <li>There is a serious flaw in the SIS380x firmware. It does not reset the prescaler
      counter to 0 when new prescale value is written. This means, for example, that if
      one were using internal channel advance with 0.1 second dwell time (prescaler=1e6)
      and then switched to external channel advance, it will take a random number between
      0 and 1e6 external channel advance pulses before it counts the first channel. This
      could take weeks! I have added a workaround in the driver until the firmware is
      fixed.</li>
    <li>Floating point registers were not being saved in interrupt service routine</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Tim Mooney found and fixed a problem in the ICB routines which was causing crashes
    if an unknown ICB module, such as the TCA or DSP was present.</p>
  <p>
    Made changes to the AIM software to allow it to run on the PowerPC.
  </p>
  <p>
    Improved performance of the erase command in mcaRecord.c by not sending a read_data
    request to device support after an erase, just clear the array in the record and
    post a monitor on the VAL field.</p>
  <p>
    Previously the<code> nmc_acqu_setelapsed</code> command (in <code>nmc_user_subs_2.c)</code>
    always did the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Queried acquisition status </li>
    <li>Turned acquisition off (even if it was off) </li>
    <li>Set the elapsed times </li>
    <li>Turned acquisition back on if it had been on </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <code>nmc_acqu_setelapsed</code> cannot set the elapsed times if the AIM is acquiring.
    However, this method has a lot of extra overhead if the AIM is not acquiring.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moved the logic into device support. Only turn off acquisition if it is determined
    to be on by the ACQG field in the record. This improves performance. It also improves
    accuracy if the AIM is acquiring, because the erase and setelapsed will now both
    be done with acquisition off.
  </p>

    December 6, 1999</h2>
  <p>
    This documents the changes made to mcaApp since synApps_R3.13.1.1. The changes have
    been substantial, and users must make a number of simultaneous changes in order
    to use the new release:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the new mcaRecord (mcaRecord.dbd, mcaRecord.c)</li>
    <li>Use the new databases (mca.db, 13element.db, 3element.db, Struck8.db) </li>
    <li>Use the new IDL code (mca__define.pro, epics_mca__define.pro, med__define.pro,
      epics_med__define.pro, mca_display__define.pro, etc.)</li>
    <li>Use the new MEDM ADL files (mca.adl, mca_small.adl, mcaSetup.adl, 13element.adl,
      3element.adl, Struck8.adl, etc.)</li>
    <li>Modify startup files st.cmd, to use the INP parameter rather than CARD and SIGNAL.
      This change is necessary in order to accomodate new device support for the IP330
      ADC and the XIA DXP CAMAC module.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The changes to mcaApp are described below in roughly decreasing order of significance.</p>
  <h3>
    Changes to databases</h3>
  <p>
    The databases mca.db, 3element.db and 13element.db have been changed significantly.
    A new database, Struck8.db has been added to support 8 channel data acquisition
    using the Struck ST7201 or SIS 380x multichannel scaler.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Previous versions of these databases had a PV called $(P)Start. This PV acted
      like the .CNT field in the Joerger scaler, i.e. it was 1 when the MCA was counting,
      0 when it was done. Writing a 1 to this PV would erase the spectra and start acquisition,
      while writing a 0 would stop acquisition. The PV would also automatically change
      state if acquisition was started or stopped by any other means, for example when
      the preset acquisition time was reached. Implementation of this PV made the databases
      quite complex, and subject to a number of race conditions which made them unreliable.
      In order to simplify the databases and make them much more robust the single $(P)Start
      PV has been eliminated. It has been replaced by several separate PVs in each database.<ul>
        <li><tt>$(P)EraseStart</tt>. Processing this PV (i.e. writing anything to it) causes
          the spectra to tbe erase and then aquisition to start. It simply processes <tt>$(P)Erase</tt>
          or <tt>$(P)EraseAll </tt>and then <tt>$(P)Start </tt>or <tt>$(P)StartAll.</tt>This
          is now the PV which should be used as a detector trigger in the scan record.</li>
        <li><tt>$(P)Erase</tt>(in mca.db) or <tt>$(P)EraseAll</tt> (in the multi-element databases
          3element.db, 13element.db and Struck8.db). Processing this PV (i.e. writing anything
          to it) causes the spectra to be erased.</li>
        <li><tt>$(P)Start </tt>(in mca.db) or <tt>$(P)StartAll</tt> (in the multi-element
          databases). Processing this PV (i.e. writing anything to it) causes aqusition to
          start without first erasing the spectra.</li>
        <li><tt>$(P)Stop </tt>(in mca.db) or <tt>$(P)StopAll</tt> (in the multi-element databases).
          Processing this PV (i.e. writing anything to it) causes aqusition to stop.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There MEDM .adl files (mca.adl, mca_small.adl, 13element.adl, etc.) have been changed
        to reflect these changes in the databases.</p>
    </li>
    <li>The previous version of mca.db used the parameters CARD and SIGNAL to specify
      the hardware address of the input for the AIM and Struck/SIS. However, these parameters
      are not sufficient for the new Ip330Sweep and DXP device support, which require
      additional addressing information. Thus, these parameters were eliminated, and replaced
      by the single INP parameter, which is used to provide complete addressing information.
      Unfortunately this means that all st.cmd files will need to be modified. For the
      AIM replace lines like the following:
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <tt>dbLoadRecords("share/mcaApp/Db/mca.db", "P=13BMD:, M=aim_adc1, DTYPE=Canberra
            AIM MCA, CARD=0, SIGNAL=0, NCHAN=2048")</tt></p>
        <p>
          with</p>
        <p>
          <tt>dbLoadRecords("share/mcaApp/Db/mca.db", "P=13BMD:, M=aim_adc1, DTYPE=Canberra
            AIM MCA, INP=#C0 S0, NCHAN=2048")</tt></p>
        <p>
          For the Struck/SIS replace lines like:</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <tt>dbLoadRecords("share/mcaApp/Db/mca.db", "P=13LAB:, M=mca_str2, DTYPE=Struck STR7201
            MCS, NCHAN=1024, CARD=0, SIGNAL=1")</tt></p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          with</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <tt>dbLoadRecords("share/mcaApp/Db/mca.db", "P=13LAB:, M=mca_str2, DTYPE=Struck STR7201
            MCS, NCHAN=1024, INP=#C0 S1")</tt></p>
        <p>
          For the Ip330Sweep use lines like</p>
        <p>
          <tt>dbLoadRecords("share/mcaApp/Db/mca_ip330.db", "P=13LAB:, M=mip330_1, DTYPE=ip330Sweep,
            NCHAN=2048, INP=#C1 S0 @c-Ip330Sweep")</tt></p>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>The previous version of these databases had a PV called IdlBusy. This PV was intended
      to be used to synchronize with IDL running on a workstation. In particular it was
      intended to be used to cause a scan to wait until IDL had written spectral data
      to disk before continuing the scan. However, IdlBusy was not correctly implemented
      in any of these databases, and was not being used by the IDL EPICS_MCA or EPICS_MED
      class libraries. The new databases do implement this concept in a robust and general
      way. The PV is no longer called IdlBusy, but rather is called ClientWait. Each database
      contains records like the following:
      <pre>grecord(bo,"$(P)$(M)Start") {

        field(OMSL,"closed_loop")

        field(DOL,"1")

        field(OUT,"$(P)$(M).STRT  CA MS")

        field(FLNK,"$(P)$(M)SetClientWait")

}



# These records are to synchronize with IDL or another client

grecord(bo,"$(P)$(M)EnableWait") {

      field(ZNAM,"Disable")

      field(ONAM,"Enable")

}



grecord(bo,"$(P)$(M)SetClientWait") {

      field(DISV,"0")

      field(SDIS,"$(P)$(M)EnableWait NPP NMS")

      field(OMSL,"closed_loop")

      field(DOL,"1")

      field(OUT,"$(P)$(M)ClientWait PP MS")

}



grecord(busy,"$(P)$(M)ClientWait") {}

</pre>
      <p>
        The logic behind these records is quite simple. <tt>EnableWait</tt> is used to enable
        or disable waiting for <tt>ClientWait</tt>. It is disabled at iocInit, and can be
        enabled/disabled from mcaSetup.adl. Each time acquisition is started via the database
        <tt>SetClientWait</tt> is processed. If <tt>EnableWait</tt> is enabled, then <tt>ClientWait</tt>
        changes to 1. If a scan record detector trigger was what caused acquisition to start,
        then the scan will wait until <tt>ClientWait</tt> goes back to 0 before it moves
        the positioners to the next point. IDL or another client can read the data from
        the MCA record, write it to disk (or do anything else with it) and then write 0
        to <tt>ClientWait</tt> when it is OK for the scan to proceed. The IDL procedures
        EPICS_MCA::WRITE_FILE and EPICS_MED::WRITE_FILE have been changed to set <tt>ClientWait</tt>to
        0 after the data are written to disk. There are two minor limitations of this synchronization
        mechanism:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the user forgets to disable <tt>EnableWait </tt>and an IDL or other client
          is not running, then the scan will hang. However, there is a control in mcaSetup.adl
          to manually clear (or set) <tt>ClientWait</tt>.</li>
        <li>Since the IDL file writing procedures always clear <tt>ClientWait </tt>it is important
          that this be done last if there is a complex set of things to be done by the client
          at each point in the scan.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Changes to MEDM .adl files</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added new .adl files for the Struck8 database (Struck8.adl, Struck8_plots.adl,
      Struck8_cal.adl Struck8_ROI.adl)</li>
    <li>Modified mca.adl, mca_small.adl, 13element.adl, 3element.adl to reflect the databases
      changes to <tt>Start, StartAll, EraseStart,</tt> etc.</li>
    <li>Added <tt>EnableWait</tt> and <tt>ClientWait</tt> to 13element.adl, 3element.adl
      and mcaSetup.adl</li>
    <li>Added individual plot menus to 13element.adl and 3element.adl.</li>
    <li>Changed format of <tt>.DWEL</tt> to exponential in mcaSetup.adl so that small
      dwell times are legible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>
    New device support - Ip330Sweep</h3>
  <p>
    New device support has been added for the Acromag IP-330 ADC acting as a waveform
    recorder/transient digitizer, i.e. the MCA spectrum contains voltage as a function
    of time. This device support allows one to capture up to 32 waveforms nearly simultaneously.
    Times per point as short as 100 microseconds are possible with up to 6 waveforms.
    The device support and documentation is not in mcaApp, but rather in mpf/ip330App.
    This device support requires MPF. It can run either on a single CPU (e.g. MVME162
    running both EPICS and MPF) or on a multiple CPU system (e.g. MVME167 running EPICS
    and MVME162 running MPF).</p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Changes to mcaRecord.c and mcaRecord.dbd</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added RTIM (read time) field. This is the time when the data were last read from
      the hardware. It is used by clients to accurately compute counts/second.</li>
    <li>Trimmed the STIM field so precision is only .001 sec </li>
    <li>Support asynchronous device support for read-status and read-data. This is required
      by the IP-330 ADC device support which is based on MPF. Added RDNS, ACQP, ERTP,
      ELTP, ACTP, and DWLP fields.</li>
    <li>Allowed device support to change DWEL to reflect actual, vs requested, dwell time.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Changes to devMCA_AIM.c</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug with dwell time. Changes to dwell time were changing instead the preset
      real time. The dwell time should be ignorred, since the Canberra MCS hardware does
      not support programmable dwell time.</li>
    <li>Minor fixes to eliminate compiler warnings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Changes to Makefile.Host</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added mca.h to INC. Required so MPF can access it.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Changes to Makefile.Vx and mcaLIBOBJS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added icbAdcSub.o, icbAmpSub.o, and icbHVPSSub.o to mcaLibOBJS, removed as separate
      products in Makefile.Vx.</li>
    <li>Added device support for Ip330Sweep, <tt>$(MPF_BIN)/devMcaIp330.o</tt> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Changes to devSTR7201.c and drvSTR7201.c</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed bug in drvSTR7201.c which caused the IOC to crash if the first command after
      iocInit was a start acquire command rather than an erase command.</li>
    <li>Fixed minor bug in the elapsed time logic in drvSTR7201.c. If acquisition was
      manually stopped and then restarted the elapsed time was reset to zero. It now continues
      to increase from the value it had when when acquisition was stopped.</li>
    <li>Changed <tt>#include &lt;file&gt;</tt> to <tt>#include "file"</tt> for some files
      so <tt>gnumake depends</tt>works correctly. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Changes to icb_control_subs.c, icb_control_subs2.c, icb_handler_subs.c, icb_read_regs.c,
    icb_show_modules.c, nmc_comm_subs_2.c, nmc_test.c, icb_sys_defs.h</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Minor changes to eliminate compiler warnings. Main change was to modify files
      to consistently use <tt>unsigned char</tt> rather than <tt>char</tt>.</li>
  </ul>
