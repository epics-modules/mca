<A NAME="Overview">
<H2>Overview</H2></A>
<P>
The Canberra 556 AIM is an Ethernet multichannel analyzer in a NIM form factor.
It has 2 ADC inputs, and a total of about 64K channels, each 32-bits deep.  
It can control programmable devices such as amplifiers, ADCs, high-voltage
power supplies, etc. using an auxilliary bus called the Instrument Control Bus (ICB).

<P>
The AIM uses the IEEE 802.2 Extended SNAP protocol, which is a low-level protocol, 
and does not use TCP/IP.
The protocol is not routeable, so the AIM must be placed on the same physical subnet
as the IOC that is controlling it.

<P>
The AIM has a concept of module "ownership", i.e. a particular computer that can control it.
Once an AIM is "owned" only that one computer can control the AIM,
all other computers are prevented from accessing it.  When the AIM is first powered on it is unowned,
and any computer can take ownership.  The EPICS driver attempts to gain ownership during the AIMConfig
command.  If it cannot, then it prints an error message.  If the AIM is currently owned by another
computer and you want to change what computer owns it, you can do one of two things.  Either power
off the AIM and back on, or issue the command mcaAIMFreeModule, described below.

<P>
The AIM and ICB device support runs on vxWorks, Linux, and Cygwin.  It should also build
and run on other Unix systems, including Mac OS X, as long as the 
<A HREF="http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet/">libnet</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.htm/">libpcap</A>
libraries are available and installed.  Note that Linux often comes with libpcap installed,
but libnet often needs to be obtained separately.  On Cygwin it is not necessary to 
install libnet, and only the WinPcap driver, as explained in the Cygwin notes below.

<P>
The device support for the Canberra hardware uses the following:
<UL>
  <LI> 
    The MCA record device support is supplied by the device-independent
    file devMcaAsyn.c.  This device support communicates with the 
    device-dependent file, drvMcaAIMAsyn.c.  This file implements an asyn
    server.  There is one server per ADC input on the AIM module.  The asyn
    "address" field is used to implement multiple-spectra per ADC, either using
    the Canberra multiplexor, or multi-channel scaler module.
  <LI>
    The ICB device support is done using the generic EPICS asyn device support
    provide in the asyn package.  It communicates with an asyn driver, drvIcbAsyn.c.
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="AIM MCA setup">
<H2>AIM MCA setup</H2></A>
<P>
There is a separate asyn server for each ADC input port on an AIM.  
Each AIM can thus have two asyn ports associated with it.
Each port card can have multiple "addresses", where each address is a region 
of AIM memory associated with a physical signal input.  Each input signal can have
more than one "sequence" or time-slice allocated to it. The configuration of an
AIM input with an asyn port, and the allocation of memory within
the AIM for this input is done by routine AIMConfig.  AIMConfig is called as 
follows:

<PRE>
# AIMConfig(portName, ethernet_address, portNumber(1 or 2), maxChans,
#           maxSignals, maxSequences, ethernetDevice)
</PRE>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    "portName" is a name for this asyn port. This name is chosen by the user.
  <LI> 
    "ethernetAddress" is the Ethernet address of the AIM, specified as a 2-byte
    hex number as printed on the front of the AIM, for example 0xE85.
  <LI> 
    "portNumber" is the ADC port number on the AIM, either 1 or 2.
  <LI> 
    "maxChans" is the maximum number of channels for each input signal.
    When using the multiplexor this value must agree with the switch setting
    inside the multiplexor, e.g. 1024, 2048, etc.
    When using the MCS this value must agree with the front panel switch,
    e.g. 256, 512, 1024, etc.
  <LI> 
    "maxSignals" is the maximum number of inputs which will be used with this
    port. When using the multiplexor this value must agree with the switch 
    setting inside the multiplexor, i.e. 1, 2, 4, or 8.  When using the MCS 
    this value must agree with the front panel switch, e.g. 1, 2, 4, or 8.
    If a multiplexor or MCS is not being used specify 1.
  <LI>
    "maxSequences" is the maximum number of sequences or time slices which 
    will be used with this port.  If time-resolved work is not being done
    specify 1.
  <LI>
    "ethernetDevice is the name of the Ethernet device for the network on
    which the AIM resides.  Some typical examples are:
    <UL>
      <LI>
        ei0 for Motorola 68 boards with vxWorks. 
      <LI> 
        dc0 for PowerPC boards with vxWorks
      <LI> 
        eth0 or eth1 for network cards on Linux
      <LI> 
        \Device\NPF_{8ECC055D-047F-11D1-A537-0000F8753ED1} for
        Windows (Cygwin).  The very long hex number is unique for
        each computer.  How to determine this number is described in the Cygwin
        section below.
    </UL>
</UL>

The total amount of memory (in channels) allocated for the port will be
maxChans*maxSignals*maxSequences.  
The total amount of memory in the AIM is about 64,000 channels, and this is
shared by the two ports.
<P>
When creating an MCA record which uses the AIM device support the INP field
must be specified in the form:
<PRE>
    @asyn(portName address),NCHAN=nchans
</PRE>
where:
<UL>
  <LI>
    portName is defined in the call to AIMConfig.
  <LI>
    address must be less than maxSignals defined in the call to AIMConfig
  <LI>
    nchans must less than maxChans defined in the call to AIMConfig
</UL>

<P>

<H3>Example MCA startup script</H3>
<P>
Assume we have an AIM with Ethernet address 0x59e.  To port 1 of this AIM there
is a single ADC which is set for 2048 channels.  This ADC will be used for
"conventional" data acquisition, i.e. with no multiplexor and not doing 
time-resolved work. To port 2 of this AIM there is a multiplexor.  The switches
in the multiplexor have been set for 4 inputs and 4096 channels.  The records
for these multiplexor inputs only use 1024 channels in this example.
<P>
The system has a second AIM at Ethernet address 0x100.  To port 1 of this AIM 
there is a single ADC which is set for 1024 channels.  This ADC will be used
for time-resolved work, and we want to collect 20 spectra within the AIM. To
port 2 of this AIM there is an MCS which has front panel switches set to 2
inputs and 8192 channels.

</PRE>
<P>
Note that it is convenient to set the multiplexor switches for the largest
spectral size and largest number of inputs which you anticipate using.  Smaller
spectral sizes can be selected by setting NCHAN in the startup script
(=NUSE and NMAX in MCA record) to a smaller value, 
without having to open the multiplexor and change the switch settings.
Extra inputs are ignored simply by not assigning any records to those inputs.
The only disadvantage of this approach is that it wastes AIM memory.  However,
the AIM has a total of more than 64,000 channels of acquisition memory which is
more than enough for many applications.

<P>
<A NAME="ICB setup">
<H2>ICB setup</H2></A>
<P>
There is a separate asyn server for ICB module (such as an ADC, amplifier, etc.)
The configuration of an ICB module and creation of the asyn server 
is done by routine ICBConfig.  ICBConfig is called as 
follows:
<PRE>
#icbConfig(portName, module, ethernetAddress, icbAddress, moduleType)
</PRE>
<UL>
  <LI> 
    "portName" is a name for this asyn port. This name is chosen by the user.
  <LI> 
    "ethernetAddress" is the Ethernet address of the AIM to which this ICB module
    is connected, specified as a 2-byte hex number as printed on the front of the AIM, 
    for example 0xE85.
  <LI> 
    "icbAddress" is the address of this ICB module, which is set by the rotary switch
    inside the ICB module.
  <LI> 
    "moduleType" is the module type (number between 0 and 4) of this ICB module.  
    The following is the list of supported ICB modules and associated module type
    numbers.
  <UL>
    <LI> 0 = ADC (9635)
    <LI> 1 = Amplifier (9615)
    <LI> 2 = High voltage power supply (HVPS) (9641, 9645)
    <LI> 3 = Three-channel analyzer (TCA) (2016)
    <LI> 4 = Digital signal processor (DSP) (9660)
  </UL>
</UL>

The following lines show how to set up ICB modules in an EPICS startup script.
This assumes an AIM at address 0x59e, an ADC at ICB address 5, an amplifier at
ICB address 3, a HVPS at ICB address 2, a TCA at ICB address 8, and a DSP at ICB
address 7.  The LIMIT parameter for the HVPS specifies the maximum voltage.
The MCA parameter for the TCA specifies an associated MCA record for which programming
the first three ROIs will program the TCA windows.

<A NAME="Utility commands">
<H2>Utility commands</H2></A>
<P>
There are several commands for the Canberra support that are defined in the EPICS iocsh shell.  
<UL>
  <LI>
    AIMConfig and icbConfig are described above. 
  <LI>
    mcaAIMShowModules lists all of the AIM modules found on the local subnet,
    with the names and MAC addresses of their owners, and their status.  (The
    nmc_show_modules command at the vxWorks shell is equivalent.)
  <LI>
    icbShowModules lists all of the ICB modules found on AIMs that are owned
    by this IOC, with their module types and some low-level information.
   (The icb_show_modules command at the vxWorks shell is equivalent.)
  <LI>
    mcaAIMFreeModule releases ownership of an AIM module.  The syntax is
    "mcaAIMFreeModule moduleNumber forceFlag".  moduleNumber is the index number
    of the AIM in the list of modules produced by mcaAIMShowModules, where the
    first module is index 0, the second module index 1, etc.  If forceFlag
    is 0 (the default) then it is only possible to release ownership of AIM
    modules that are owned by this IOC.  If forceFlag is 1 then it forces the
    AIM to become unowned, even if this IOC is not currently the owner.
    (The nmc_freemodule command at the vxWorks shell is equivalent.)
</UL>

<A NAME="vxWorks configuration">
<H2>vxWorks configuration</H2></A>
<P>
The driver on vxWorks uses the functions "etherInputHookAdd" and "etherOutput".
These functions exist in vxWorks 5.4, but they have been eliminated in vxWorks 5.5.
Thus, it is not possible to use the existing driver for vxWorks 5.5.  There is a new
interface in vxWorks that should make it possible to write a driver that will
work on both 5.4 and 5.5, but this has not yet been done.  There is nothing special
that needs to be done to build the driver or run it in vxWorks 5.4.

<P>
<A NAME="Linux configuration">
<H2>Linux configuration</H2></A>

<UL>
  <LI>
    libcap.  This is often installed by default on Linux systems, but if it is not you
    will need to install it.
  <LI>
    libnet.  This typically needs to be installed.  Version 1.1 or higher must be used,
    the older 1.0 version will not work.
</UL>
The libnet (and possibly libpcap?) libraries need root permission in order to send non-TCP/IP
packets on the network.  Thus, the EPICS IOC application must be run by someone with root privilege,
or else the application must be installed with SUID root.

<P>
<A NAME="Windows configuration">
<H2>Windows configuration</H2></A>

The following must be installed:
<UL>
  <LI>WinPcap from <A HREF="http://www.winpcap.org/">www.winpcap.org</A>.  Only the autoinstaller with 
drivers and DLLS needs to be installed.  The EPICS Canberra device support includes the header
and library files from WinPcap, so it is not necessary to install the WinPcap developer's pack.  
</UL>

<P>
Although the Cygwin driver uses libnet, it is not necessary to install libnet on your
PC.  The EPICS software for the Canberra includes pre-built libnet header and library files.

<P>
It is necessary to specify the name of the Ethernet device in the AIMConfig command in
the EPICS startup script. This is of the format:
<P>
\Device\NPF_{8ECC055D-047F-11D1-A537-0000F8753ED1}
<P>
The long number at the end is unique to each network card.  You can get this number for your Window machine by
using the "regedit" utility, and doing an "export" of the key:
<P>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards]
<P>
This should look like:
<PRE>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards\2]
"ServiceName"="{15B576D2-6DF4-4C9F-B53C-DBF76B53194E}"
"Description"="3Com 3C920 Integrated Fast Ethernet Controller (3C905C-TX Compatible)"
</PRE>

The number that is needed in the ServiceName field.  Copy this number and paste into the AIMConfig command in
your st.cmd startup command file.

<P>
<A NAME="Time-resolved measurements">
<H2>Time-resolved measurements</H2></A>

For time-resolved spectroscopy it is very desirable to be able to rapidly
change the region of the AIM memory into which an ADC acquires. 
The .SEQ field in the MCA record is designed for this purpose, and it is
implemented in the AIM device support. 
By rapidly incrementing the value of the .SEQ field, for example
with a database or Channel Access client, one can 
acquire a number of spectra in rapid succession, without incurring the delay of
reading the spectra from the AIM and erasing the memory between acquisitions. 
The only delay is the few msec required to transmit a message changing the
memory address of acquisition.  

<P>
<A NAME="Performance Measurements">
<H2>Performance Measurements</H2></A>
<P>


The following IDL program measures how fast time-resolved data can be acquired.
It was tested with record 13LAB:aim_adc1 configured with maxSequences=4 and
with an input pulser at about 100 kHz.

<PRE>
;************************************************************
; This program tests the time-resolved spectroscopy capabilities of the
; new MCA record with the AIM.  The hardware configuration is an ADC with
; pulses coming in at about 100 kHz.

; Create EPICS MCA object
rec = '13LAB:aim_adc1'
casettimeout, .005  ; Fast channel access timeout
max_sequences = 4
mca = obj_new('epics_mca', rec)

; Turn of acquisition, erase all of the spectra in the AIM
mca->acquire_off
for i=0,max_sequences-1 do begin
   mca->set_sequence, i
   mca->erase
endfor

; Acquire data in sequence 0 for 1 second to determine input count rate
mca->set_sequence, 0
presets = mca->get_presets()
presets.real_time = 1.0
presets.live_time = 0.0
mca->set_presets, presets
mca->erase
mca->acquire_on
mca->acquire_wait

count_rate = total(data)
print, 'Input count rate = ', count_rate

; Clear presets, erase sequence 0

mca->set_presets, presets
mca->erase

; Now collect time-resolved spectra as fast as possible
mca->acquire_on
t0 = systime(1)
for i=0,max_sequences-1 do begin
   mca->set_sequence, i
endfor
t1 = systime(1)
mca->acquire_off

print, 'Elapsed time for time-resolved spectra= ', t1-t0
; Read out each spectrum, print number of counts
time = fltarr(max_sequences)
for i=0, max_sequences-1 do begin
    mca->set_sequence, i
    data = mca->get_data()
    time(i) = total(data)/count_rate
    print, '  Total counts in sequence ', i, ' = ', total(data)
    print, '    time in sequence = ', time(i) * 1000., ' msec.'
endfor
print, 'Real time = ', t1-t0
print, 'Live time = ', total(time)
print, 'Dead time = ', total(time)/(t1-t0)*100., ' percent'
end
;************************************************************

The following are the results of the test:

Input count rate =       125459.
Elapsed time for time-resolved spectra=       0.24195898
  Total counts in sequence        0 =       8187.00
    time in sequence =       65.2564 msec.
  Total counts in sequence        1 =       3787.00
    time in sequence =       30.1852 msec.
  Total counts in sequence        2 =       3803.00
    time in sequence =       30.3127 msec.
  Total counts in sequence        3 =       2862.00
    time in sequence =       22.8122 msec.
Real time =       0.24195898
Live time =      0.148566
Dead time =        61.401506 percent
</PRE>
<P>
The total elapsed time to collect 4 time-resolved spectra is 241 msec.  The
first spectrum collected for 65 msec (because it includes the overhead of the
acquire on command), while the other spectra were collected for 20-30 msec.
The dead time was about 100 msec for 4 spectra, or about 25 msec per spectrum.
Note that if the .SEQ field were incremented by a process in the crate, rather
than IDL channel access the performance might be somewhat better.
<P>
The conclusion is that the MCA record and AIM can acquire about 20 spectra
per second, which is fast enough for many applications.
