  <h2 id="Overview">
    Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Canberra 556 AIM is an Ethernet multichannel analyzer in a NIM form factor.
    It has 2 ADC inputs, and a total of about 64K channels, each 32-bits deep. It can
    control programmable devices such as amplifiers, ADCs, high-voltage power supplies,
    etc. using an auxilliary bus called the Instrument Control Bus (ICB).
  </p>
  <p>
    The AIM uses the IEEE 802.2 Extended SNAP protocol, which is a low-level protocol,
    and does not use TCP/IP. The protocol is not routeable, so the AIM must be placed
    on the same physical subnet as the IOC that is controlling it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The AIM has a concept of module "ownership", i.e. a particular computer that can
    control it. Once an AIM is "owned" only that one computer can control the AIM, all
    other computers are prevented from accessing it. When the AIM is first powered on
    it is unowned, and any computer can take ownership. The EPICS driver attempts to
    gain ownership during the AIMConfig command. If it cannot, then it prints an error
    message. If the AIM is currently owned by another computer and you want to change
    what computer owns it, you can do one of two things. Either power off the AIM and
    back on, or issue the command mcaAIMFreeModule, described below.
  </p>
  <p>
    The DSA-2000 is functionally the same as the AIM, but with a single ADC port and
    packaged in a rack-mount unit. The DSA-2000 contains the equivalent of the 9660
    DSP which is set at ICB address 0. The DSA-2000 also contains an internal programmable
    high-voltage power supply. This is not the same as the ICB power supplies, and has
    its own driver described below.
  </p>
  <p>
    The AIM and ICB device support runs on vxWorks, Linux, and Windows (win32-x86 and
    cygwin-x86). It should also build and run on other Unix systems, including Mac OS
    X, as long as the <a href="http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet/">libnet</a> and
    <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.htm/">libpcap</a> libraries are available and
    installed. Note that Linux often comes with libpcap installed, but libnet often
    needs to be obtained separately. On Cygwin it is not necessary to install libnet,
    and only the WinPcap driver, as explained in the Cygwin notes below.
  </p>
  <p>
    The device support for the Canberra hardware uses the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The MCA record device support is supplied by the device-independent file devMcaAsyn.c.
      This device support communicates with the device-dependent file, drvMcaAIMAsyn.c.
      This file implements an asyn server. There is one server per ADC input on the AIM
      module. The asyn "address" field is used to implement multiple-spectra per ADC,
      either using the Canberra multiplexor, or multi-channel scaler module.</li>
    <li>The ICB device support is done using the generic EPICS asyn device support provide
      in the asyn package. It communicates with an asyn driver, drvIcbAsyn.c.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="AIM_MCA_setup">
    AIM MCA setup</h2>
  <p>
    There is a separate asyn server for each ADC input port on an AIM. Each AIM can
    thus have two asyn ports associated with it. Each port card can have multiple "addresses",
    where each address is a region of AIM memory associated with a physical signal input.
    Each input signal can have more than one "sequence" or time-slice allocated to it.
    The configuration of an AIM input with an asyn port, and the allocation of memory
    within the AIM for this input is done by routine AIMConfig. AIMConfig is called
    as follows:</p>
  <pre>
# AIMConfig(portName, ethernet_address, portNumber(1 or 2), maxChans,
#           maxSignals, maxSequences, ethernetDevice)
</pre>
  <ul>
    <li>"portName" is a name for this asyn port. This name is chosen by the user.</li>
    <li>"ethernetAddress" is the Ethernet address of the AIM, specified as a 2-byte hex
      number as printed on the front of the AIM, for example 0xE85.</li>
    <li>"portNumber" is the ADC port number on the AIM, either 1 or 2.</li>
    <li>"maxChans" is the maximum number of channels for each input signal. When using
      the multiplexor this value must agree with the switch setting inside the multiplexor,
      e.g. 1024, 2048, etc. When using the MCS this value must agree with the front panel
      switch, e.g. 256, 512, 1024, etc.</li>
    <li>"maxSignals" is the maximum number of inputs which will be used with this port.
      When using the multiplexor this value must agree with the switch setting inside
      the multiplexor, i.e. 1, 2, 4, or 8. When using the MCS this value must agree with
      the front panel switch, e.g. 1, 2, 4, or 8. If a multiplexor or MCS is not being
      used specify 1.</li>
    <li>"maxSequences" is the maximum number of sequences or time slices which will be
      used with this port. If time-resolved work is not being done specify 1.</li>
    <li>"ethernetDevice is the name of the Ethernet device for the network on which the
      AIM resides. Some typical examples are:
      <ul>
        <li>ei0 for Motorola 68 boards with vxWorks. </li>
        <li>dc0 for PowerPC boards with vxWorks</li>
        <li>eth0 or eth1 for network cards on Linux</li>
        <li>\Device\NPF_{8ECC055D-047F-11D1-A537-0000F8753ED1} for Windows (Cygwin). The very
          long hex number is unique for each computer. How to determine this number is described
          in the Cygwin section below.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The total amount of memory (in channels) allocated for the port will be maxChans*maxSignals*maxSequences.
    The total amount of memory in the AIM is about 64,000 channels, and this is shared
    by the two ports.</p>
  <p>
    When creating an MCA record which uses the AIM device support the INP field must
    be specified in the form:</p>
  <pre>
    @asyn(portName address),NCHAN=nchans
</pre>
  <p>
    where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>portName is defined in the call to AIMConfig.</li>
    <li>address must be less than maxSignals defined in the call to AIMConfig</li>
    <li>nchans must less than maxChans defined in the call to AIMConfig</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    Example MCA startup script</h3>
  <p>
    Assume we have an AIM with Ethernet address 0x59e. To port 1 of this AIM there is
    a single ADC which is set for 2048 channels. This ADC will be used for "conventional"
    data acquisition, i.e. with no multiplexor and not doing time-resolved work. To
    port 2 of this AIM there is a multiplexor. The switches in the multiplexor have
    been set for 4 inputs and 4096 channels. The records for these multiplexor inputs
    only use 1024 channels in this example.</p>
  <p>
    The system has a second AIM at Ethernet address 0x100. To port 1 of this AIM there
    is a single ADC which is set for 1024 channels. This ADC will be used for time-resolved
    work, and we want to collect 20 spectra within the AIM. To port 2 of this AIM there
    is an MCS which has front panel switches set to 2 inputs and 8192 channels.

  <p>
    Note that it is convenient to set the multiplexor switches for the largest spectral
    size and largest number of inputs which you anticipate using. Smaller spectral sizes
    can be selected by setting NCHAN in the startup script (=NUSE and NMAX in MCA record)
    to a smaller value, without having to open the multiplexor and change the switch
    settings. Extra inputs are ignored simply by not assigning any records to those
    inputs. The only disadvantage of this approach is that it wastes AIM memory. However,
    the AIM has a total of more than 64,000 channels of acquisition memory which is
    more than enough for many applications.</p>
  <h2 id="ICB_setup">
    ICB setup</h2>
  <p>
    There is a separate asyn server for ICB module (such as an ADC, amplifier, etc.)
    The configuration of an ICB module and creation of the asyn server is done by routine
    ICBConfig. ICBConfig is called as follows:</p>
  <pre>
#icbConfig(portName, module, ethernetAddress, icbAddress, moduleType)
</pre>
  <ul>
    <li>"portName" is a name for this asyn port. This name is chosen by the user.</li>
    <li>"ethernetAddress" is the Ethernet address of the AIM to which this ICB module
      is connected, specified as a 2-byte hex number as printed on the front of the AIM,
      for example 0xE85.</li>
    <li>"icbAddress" is the address of this ICB module, which is set by the rotary switch
      inside the ICB module.</li>
    <li>"moduleType" is the module type (number between 0 and 4) of this ICB module. The
      following is the list of supported ICB modules and associated module type numbers.
      <ul>
        <li>0 = ADC (9635)</li>
        <li>1 = Amplifier (9615)</li>
        <li>2 = High voltage power supply (HVPS) (9641, 9645)</li>
        <li>3 = Three-channel analyzer (TCA) (2016)</li>
        <li>4 = Digital signal processor (DSP) (9660)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following lines show how to set up ICB modules in an EPICS startup script. This
    assumes an AIM at address 0x59e, an ADC at ICB address 5, an amplifier at ICB address
    3, a HVPS at ICB address 2, a TCA at ICB address 8, and a DSP at ICB address 7.
    The LIMIT parameter for the HVPS specifies the maximum voltage. The MCA parameter
    for the TCA specifies an associated MCA record for which programming the first three
    ROIs will program the TCA windows.</p>

  <h2 id="Utility_commands">
    Utility commands</h2>
  <p>
    There are several commands for the Canberra support that are defined in the EPICS
    iocsh shell.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>AIMConfig and icbConfig are described above. </li>
    <li>mcaAIMShowModules lists all of the AIM modules found on the local subnet, with
      the names and MAC addresses of their owners, and their status. (The nmc_show_modules
      command at the vxWorks shell is equivalent.)</li>
    <li>icbShowModules lists all of the ICB modules found on AIMs that are owned by this
      IOC, with their module types and some low-level information. (The icb_show_modules
      command at the vxWorks shell is equivalent.)</li>
    <li>mcaAIMFreeModule releases ownership of an AIM module. The syntax is "mcaAIMFreeModule
      moduleNumber forceFlag". moduleNumber is the index number of the AIM in the list
      of modules produced by mcaAIMShowModules, where the first module is index 0, the
      second module index 1, etc. If forceFlag is 0 (the default) then it is only possible
      to release ownership of AIM modules that are owned by this IOC. If forceFlag is
      1 then it forces the AIM to become unowned, even if this IOC is not currently the
      owner. (The nmc_freemodule command at the vxWorks shell is equivalent.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="vxWorks_configuration">
    vxWorks configuration</h2>
  <p>
    The driver on vxWorks uses the functions in muxLib or muxTkLib. On vxWorks 6.x this
    requires that the Board Support Package (BSP) be built with the INCLUDE_NET_POOL
    option.</p>
  <h2 id="Linux_configuration">
    Linux configuration</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>libcap. This is often installed by default on Linux systems, but if it is not
      you will need to install it.</li>
    <li>libnet. This typically needs to be installed. Version 1.1 or higher must be used,
      the older 1.0 version will not work.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The libnet (and possibly libpcap?) libraries need root permission in order to send
    non-TCP/IP packets on the network. Thus, the EPICS IOC application must be run by
    someone with root privilege, or else the application must be installed with SUID
    root.</p>
  <h2 id="Windows_configuration">
    Windows configuration</h2>
  <p>
    The following must be installed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>WinPcap from <a href="http://www.winpcap.org/">www.winpcap.org</a>. Only the autoinstaller
      with drivers and DLLS needs to be installed. The EPICS Canberra device support includes
      the header and library files from WinPcap, so it is not necessary to install the
      WinPcap developer's pack.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It is necessary to specify the name of the Ethernet device in the AIMConfig command
    in the EPICS startup script. This is of the format:</p>
  <p>
    \Device\NPF_{8ECC055D-047F-11D1-A537-0000F8753ED1}
  </p>
  <p>
    The long number at the end is unique to each network card. The simplest way to get
    this name is to run with the example startup script in iocBoot/iocCygwin/st.cmd
    with the string provided in the distribution. This will fail, but the driver will
    then print out a list of all the valid network device names on your system, along
    with their descriptions. Find the one that describes the network that your Canberra
    hardware is attached to, and replace the string in the AIMConfig commands below
    with that string.</p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, you can get this number for your Window machine by using the "regedit"
    utility, and doing an "export" of the key:</p>
  <p>
    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards]
  </p>
  <p>
    This should look like:</p>
  <pre>
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards]

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards\2]
"ServiceName"="{15B576D2-6DF4-4C9F-B53C-DBF76B53194E}"
"Description"="3Com 3C920 Integrated Fast Ethernet Controller (3C905C-TX Compatible)"
</pre>
  <p>
    The number that is needed in the ServiceName field. Copy this number and paste into
    the AIMConfig command in your st.cmd startup command file.</p>
  <h2 id="Time-resolved_measurements">
    Time-resolved measurements</h2>
  <p>
    For time-resolved spectroscopy it is very desirable to be able to rapidly change
    the region of the AIM memory into which an ADC acquires. The .SEQ field in the MCA
    record is designed for this purpose, and it is implemented in the AIM device support.
    By rapidly incrementing the value of the .SEQ field, for example with a database
    or Channel Access client, one can acquire a number of spectra in rapid succession,
    without incurring the delay of reading the spectra from the AIM and erasing the
    memory between acquisitions. The only delay is the few msec required to transmit
    a message changing the memory address of acquisition.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Performance_Measurements">
    Performance Measurements</h2>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Tests were done with R6-10 of the mca module to measure the performance of the Canberra
    AIM modules in rapidly collecting spectra in a scan. The tests were done under the
    following conditions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2048 channel spectra</li>
    <li>0.01 second acquisition time, in order to attain real data but with minimal overhead.</li>
    <li>EPICS sscan record. It had no positioner drive PV to minimize overhead.
      <ul>
        <li>The positioner readback was "time".</li>
        <li>The detector was the first ROI, mca1.R0.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The scan rate for the MCA status was 0.1 second, and scan rate for the MCA read
      was Passive to minimize overhead.</li>
    <li>100 scan points were collected. There were no positioner or detector delays in
      the scan records.</li>

    The following IDL program measures how fast time-resolved data can be acquired.
    It was tested with record 13LAB:aim_adc1 configured with maxSequences=4 and with
    an input pulser at about 100 kHz.</p>
  <pre>
;************************************************************
; This program tests the time-resolved spectroscopy capabilities of the
; new MCA record with the AIM.  The hardware configuration is an ADC with
; pulses coming in at about 100 kHz.

; Create EPICS MCA object
rec = '13LAB:aim_adc1'
casettimeout, .005  ; Fast channel access timeout
max_sequences = 4
mca = obj_new('epics_mca', rec)

; Turn of acquisition, erase all of the spectra in the AIM
mca->acquire_off
for i=0,max_sequences-1 do begin
   mca->set_sequence, i
   mca->erase
endfor

; Acquire data in sequence 0 for 1 second to determine input count rate
mca->set_sequence, 0
presets = mca->get_presets()
presets.real_time = 1.0
presets.live_time = 0.0
mca->set_presets, presets
mca->erase
mca->acquire_on
mca->acquire_wait
data = mca->get_data()
count_rate = total(data)
print, 'Input count rate = ', count_rate

; Clear presets, erase sequence 0
presets.live_time = 0.0
mca->set_presets, presets
mca->erase

; Now collect time-resolved spectra as fast as possible
mca->acquire_on
t0 = systime(1)
for i=0,max_sequences-1 do begin
   mca->set_sequence, i
endfor
t1 = systime(1)
mca->acquire_off

print, 'Elapsed time for time-resolved spectra= ', t1-t0
; Read out each spectrum, print number of counts
time = fltarr(max_sequences)
for i=0, max_sequences-1 do begin
    mca->set_sequence, i
    data = mca->get_data()
    time(i) = total(data)/count_rate
    print, '  Total counts in sequence ', i, ' = ', total(data)
    print, '    time in sequence = ', time(i) * 1000., ' msec.'
endfor
print, 'Real time = ', t1-t0
print, 'Live time = ', total(time)
print, 'Dead time = ', total(time)/(t1-t0)*100., ' percent'
end
;************************************************************

The following are the results of the test:

Input count rate =       125459.
Elapsed time for time-resolved spectra=       0.24195898
  Total counts in sequence        0 =       8187.00
    time in sequence =       65.2564 msec.
  Total counts in sequence        1 =       3787.00
    time in sequence =       30.1852 msec.
  Total counts in sequence        2 =       3803.00
    time in sequence =       30.3127 msec.
  Total counts in sequence        3 =       2862.00
    time in sequence =       22.8122 msec.
Real time =       0.24195898
Live time =      0.148566
Dead time =        61.401506 percent
</pre>
  <p>
    The total elapsed time to collect 4 time-resolved spectra is 241 msec. The first
    spectrum collected for 65 msec (because it includes the overhead of the acquire
    on command), while the other spectra were collected for 20-30 msec. The dead time
    was about 100 msec for 4 spectra, or about 25 msec per spectrum. Note that if the
    .SEQ field were incremented by a process in the crate, rather than IDL channel access
    the performance might be somewhat better.</p>
  <p>
    The conclusion is that the MCA record and AIM can acquire about 20 spectra per second,
    which is fast enough for many applications.</p>
