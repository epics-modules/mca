    <b><a href="mca.html">mca</a></b> supports Multi-Channel Analyzers (hence the name),
    and also related devices such as multi-channel scalers (MCS), waveform digitizers,
    and programmable ADCs, amplifiers and power supplies.</p>
  <p>
    <b>mca</b> consists of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="mcaRecord.html">mcaRecord</a>. The mca record is device independent,
      and can be used to control a large number of devices in an identical way. The mca
      record is similar to the waveform record, in that the .VAL field is a 1-D array.
      However, the mca record provides many additional fields that are used to control
      data acquisition, regions-of-interest, etc. </li>
    <li>Device support for the MCA record using asyn drivers. This support is used by
      the <a href="mcaCanberra.html">Canberra Ethernet MCA</a> and fastSweep drivers in
      this module, as well as by the driver in the <a href="dxp.html">DXP module</a>.</li>
    <li>asyn driver support for the <a href="mcaCanberra.html">Canberra ICB programmable
      NIM modules.</a></li>
    <li>asyn driver support for the Rontec XFlash. This will work either with standard
      serial ports or with Bruker's QM100 high speed interface.</li>
    <li>Driver support for the <a href="mcaStruck.html">SIS3801 multi-channel scaler (MCS)</a>
      (formerly the STR7201 from Struck) and the SIS3820 MCS. There is support for MCS
      operation with either mca or waveform records, and for simple preset scaler operation
      with the scaler record.</li>
    <li>asyn fastSweep driver for waveform digitizer type devices. This is used by the
      <a href="ip330.html">ip330 module</a> and the <a href="quadEM.html">quadEM module</a>.</li>
  </ul>

    A basic interface to the mca record is provided with medm. These screens allow one
    to control acquisition, view spectra on a linear or logarithmic scale. There are
    no markers or cursors, or tools for energy calibration or peak fitting.</p>

    There is a setup window for controlling preset count times, update rates, etc.</p>

    An IDL MCA display program is available, shown in the screen show below. This program
    is available in both a source code version that requires and IDL license to run,
    and also in a pre-compiled form that can be run under the IDL Virtual Machine for
    free. It provides tools for energy calibration and peak fitting.</p>

  <p>
    Another IDL tool is provided for controlling multi-elemement detectors (MED). This
    screen allows one to display one spectrum at a time in the IDL MCA display tool
    above, and to turn off and on acquisition simultaneously on all detectors.</p>
  <p>
    The IDL MCA display and multi-element display tools have also been ported to Python.
    With the advent of the IDL Virtual Machine that allows IDL programs to be run for
    free I am no longer actively working on the Python versions, but it is available.</p>
