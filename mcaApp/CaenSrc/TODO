- Add way to resize buffers?
- Some parameters are still hard-coded
- Make poll period account for thread run time
- Initialize parameters in constructor or connectDevice
- Investigate how to measure live-time (perhaps discard one event and use the difference between the first and last event as elapsed time?)
- Implement PCTL and PCTH for PresetCounts
- Lean out read thread removing time tag processing
- Implement reading of pile-up events
