This directory contains files from the developers pacl of WinPcap.

They get installed before the CanberraSrc directory is built on Cygwin and
WIN32.

wpcap.lib and Packet.lib are from the Lib directory in WinPcap.

wpcap.dll and Packet.dll are from the Windows/System32 directory after an install of the WinPCAP application.
They are not included in the developers pack.

The files in os/WIN32 and os/cygwin32 are from the WinPcap Include/ Include/pcap directories. 
They are put in these os/ specific directories to avoid name conflicts with Linux.  
The pcap.h file is the one from Include/pcap.h, not the top-level Include/pcap.h.  
It has also been edited to change the #include pcap/bpf.h to just bpf.h, 
so we don't need a pcap/ subdirectory.

The versions in this directory are from the 4.1.2 release of the WinPcap developer's pack (WpdPack folder).

This directory provides all files necessary to build the CanberraSrc directory 
on win32-x86 and cygwin-x86.  However, to run the resulting application (mcaAim.exe or other
applications built with CanberraSrc) it is necessary to install the WinPcap package, because
it installs a needed driver and DLLs that are not included in this CanberraSupport directory.
It is not necessary to install the developers package for WinPcap.
