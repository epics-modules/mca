This directory contains files from the Include and Lib directories of the Npcap SDK version 1.12 for https://npcap.com.

They get installed before the CanberraSrc directory is built on WIN32.

This directory provides all files necessary to build the CanberraSrc directory 
on win32-x86, win32-x86-static, windows-x64, and windows-x64-static.  
However, to run the resulting application (mcaAim.exe or other applications built with CanberraSrc) 
it is necessary to install the Npcap Installer package, because it installs needed drivers and DLLs that are 
not included in this CanberraSupport directory.  It is not necessary to install the Npcap SDK.
