    Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The MCA record controls and acquires data from a multichannel analyzer (MCA). The
    MCA record is unlike most other EPICS records in that its processing is neither
    "synchronous" nor "asynchronous" (as these terms are used in the EPICS Record Reference
    Manual). Currently, PACT is always FALSE after record processing has completed,
    even though a read operation may be pending a callback from device support.

        is intended to help users set ROIs using a generic channel-access client.</td>

    Intended Use</h2>
  <p>
    This record should normally have its SCAN field set to "Passive", since Put's to
    the STRT and READ fields are intended to cause data acquisition and data reading
    to begin immediately, and since Put's to these "process-passive" fields can trigger
    record processing only if the record is passive.
  </p>
  <p>
    To read data periodically while acquisition is underway, arrange for a '1' to be
    poked into the READ field periodically. The following recipe arranges for the READ
    field to be poked periodically while the MCA is acquiring data.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>attach the output link of a "binary-out" (BO) record to the MCA record's READ
      field,</li>
    <li>set the BO record's value permanently to 1 (using its DOL field), </li>
    <li>attach the BO record's scan-disable link (DISL) to the MCA record's ACQG field,</li>
    <li>set the BO record's scan-disable value (DISV) to 0.</li>
    <li>set the BO record's SCAN field to the desired update rate.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Similarly, to read status periodically while acquisition is underway, arrange for
    a '1' to be poked into the PROC field periodically. The following recipe arranges
    for the PROC field to be poked periodically while the MCA is acquiring data.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>attach the output link of a "binary-out" (BO) record to the MCA record's PROC
      field,</li>
    <li>set the BO record's value permanently to 1 (using its DOL field), </li>
    <li>attach the BO record's scan-disable link (DISL) to the MCA record's ACQG field,</li>
    <li>set the BO record's scan-disable value (DISV) to 0.</li>
    <li>set the BO record's SCAN field to the desired update rate.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The file mca.db contains records to implement the above logic. It also contains
    records for Start and EraseStart that optionally set a Busy record flag to wait
    for a channel access client, such as IDL, to save the data before continuing. That
    database also contains a set of records to indicate why acquisition was stopped
    (preset time reached, user stopped it manually, etc.)</p>
