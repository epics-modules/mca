    Overview</h2>
  <p>
    These drivers support the SIS3801 and SIS3820 multi-channel scalers from <a href="http://www.struck.de/">
      Struck Innovative Systems</a>. The SIS3801 was formerly sold as the model STR7201
    from a predecessor company called Struck. All are VME modules with 8 or 32 scaler
    input channels. In this document the term SIS38XX includes all of the above modules,
    except where explicitly noted. Each input can count at 100MHz or 200MHz depending
    on model. It has an external channel advance input (called Next) which causes the
    the current scaler values to be copied to a FIFO, clears the scalers and resumes
    counting. The scalers are implemented in a dual-bank design, so that the switching
    time is less than 4 nsec.
  </p>
  <p>
    The drivers are written to support the use of the SIS38XX as a multichannel scaler.
    Up to 32 mca records (or waveform records) can be connected to each unit, each record
    corresponding to one of the signal inputs. There are additional records to control
    start and stop acquisition of the device, control the dwell time and channel advance
    source, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    The driver also supports using the SIS38XX as a conventional EPICS scaler (like
    the Joerger scaler) with the scaler record. The SIS3801 does not support counting
    for a preset time or number of counts, so the preset scaler operation is emulated
    using the FIFO. The SIS3820 does support counting for a preset counts, and so directly
    supports the scaler mode of operation without emulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The SIS38XX hardware itself is not a multichannel scaler in the conventional sense,
    since it simply contains a FIFO of scaler counts, rather than an array of memory
    locations which hold the counts for each dwell cycle. The driver for the SIS38XX
    simulates a conventional MCS by allocating a memory buffer which contains the counts
    in each dwell period. The driver copies the counts from the FIFO to this memory
    buffer. The SIS3801 has a limited amount of FIFO memory (128KB to 512KB), while
    the SIS3820 comes standard with 64MB, and optionally has 512MB. The SIS3820 also
    maps a large block (8MB) of the FIFO memory to the VME bus, so it can effectively
    use DMA operations. The SIS3801 only maps 256 bytes to the VME bus, so DMA cannot
    be effectively used.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each FIFO word contains the counts for one input signal for one dwell period. On
    the SIS3801 the FIFO can thus buffer anywhere from 1024 dwell cycles (32 active
    inputs, 128KB FIFO) to 128K dwell cycles (1 active input, 512KB FIFO). The minimum
    dwell time is in the range .5-4 microseconds, depending upon the number of active
    inputs. VME interrupts are implemented, so that FIFO readout is done automatically
    when the FIFO is half full. Even with interrupts there is a possibility of FIFO
    overflow with very short dwell times and small FIFO sizes. Users whose applications
    require short dwell times and a large number of active inputs should purchase large
    FIFO chips to prevent this. The FIFO chip can be replaced in the field. The driver
    determines the FIFO size automatically. On the SIS3820 the FIFO size is large (64MB
    to 512MB), and can be read out quickly (~ 40 MB/s) using DMA. Still, at 1 microsecond
    dwell time and 32 active inputs the data rate is 128MB/s, which is 3 times faster
    than the FIFO readout speed. Thus, users who need very large time sequences at minimum
    dwell times should chose the 512MB FIFO option.

    Hardware configuration</h2>
  <h3>
    Hardware Configuration of older STR7201 cards</h3>
  <p>
    Jumper J600 on the board must be set to select LCA file 2 (STR7201 Design 1) or
    LCA file 3 (STR7201 Design 2). With Design 1 selected the scalers are 32 bits wide.
    With Design 2 selected the scalers are 24 bits wide, and the upper 8 bits of each
    data word contain information on the channel number, bank, and 2 user bits. The
    channel number and bank information are redundant since the driver sorts the FIFO
    output by channel number when copying the data to the buffer and then to the MCA
    record. However, some applications may want to use the 2 user bits which are latched
    with each Next cycle, and Design 2 may be selected for those applications.</p>
  <p>
    The driver requires that the board be configured for VME A32 addressing, so jumper
    EN_A32 must be in place. Address selection is done with jumper J_A11, and switches
    SW_A32U, SW_A32L, SW_A24 and SW_A16. Note that the factory-default address of 0x33508000
    cannot be used with the APS version of the vxWorks board support package since this
    part of the VME A32 address space is not accessible. Each board takes up 2K bytes
    of A32 address space.</p>
  <h3>
    Hardware Configuration of SIS3801 and SIS3820 cards</h3>
  <p>
    The A32 address space must be used. The VME A32 base address must be set to a value
    that is supported by the board support package being used. The SIS3801 occupies
    2KB of address space, while the SIS3820 occupies 16MB of address space.</p>
  <p>
    The SIS3820 supports loading new firmware into the PROM using either of 2 methods:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Using an external JTAG programmer, typically a USB device with a Windows laptop.
      This method requires that pins 1 and 2 be connected on jumper JP570 (factory configuration).</li>
    <li>Over the VME bus, using a function provided with this EPICS software called sis3820_jtag_prom_epics().
      This method requires that pins 2 and 3 be connected on jumper JP570 (must be changed
      from factory configuration).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The sis3820_jtag_prom_epics() function is called from the vxWorks or iocsh shell
    as follows:</p>
  <pre>sis3820_jtag_prom_epics(baseAddress, command, mcsFile)</pre>
  <p>
    where:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>baseAddress is the VME address of the SIS3820 card. This is the same address used
      in the drvSIS3820Config command.</li>
    <li>command is one of the followiing:
      <ul>
        <li>"R" (Read configuration information)</li>
        <li>"V" (Verify the current contents of the PROM to see if it is the same as that
          in mcsFile</li>
        <li>"P" (Program the contents of mcsFile into the PROM, and then verify the result)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>mcsFile is the relative path to the new firmware file, e.g. "./prom_v0111.mcs"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The file for the latest firmware can be found either on the <a href="http://www.struck.de/sis3820firm.htm">
      SIS S8320 firmware Web site</a> or in the mca/mcaApp/SISSrc directory in the mca
    module distribution.</p>
  <h2 id="Software_architecture">
    Software architecture</h2>
  <p>
    The driver consists of a base class, drvSIS38XX.cpp, and two derived classes, drvSIS3801.cpp
    and drvSIS3820.cpp. The base class inherits from asynPortDriver, which is part of
    asyn. The driver uses the standard device-independent asyn device support for the
    MCA record. The INP link is of the form INP=@asyn(PORT, ADDR), where PORT is the
    name of the asyn port that has been created for a specific SIS38XX card, and ADDR
    is the input signal number (0-31).</p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, one can use standard EPICS waveform records for the array data, rather
    than the mca record. This uses the standard device support for the waveform record
    that comes with asyn. The example startup scripts (st_SIS3801.cmd and st_SIS3820.cmd)
    in iocBoot/iocVxWorks contain examples for loading either mca or waveform records.</p>
  <p>
    There is an EPICS SNL program, SIS38XX_SNL.st, that must be run for each SIS38XX
    card. This is a very simple program that forces each MCA or waveform record to process
    when acquisition completes before setting the Acquiring busy record back to 0. It
    also forces each MCA or waveform record to process when the ReadAll record processes.
    This logic is much easier to accomplish in an SNL program than in a database, particularly
    because the number of MCA or waveform records in the database is not fixed, but
    can be changed in the startup script.</p>
  <p>
    The SIS3801 and SIS3820 support was rewritten for R7-0 of the mca module. In previous
    releases the driver was "synchronous", meaning that the MCA records blocked while
    the arrays were read from the FIFO on the VME modules. FIFO reads were done with
    VME program I/O, which can only do about 1000 32-bit words per ms. This was acceptable
    if the arrays were small (e.g. 2048 channels) because it only took a few ms to read
    each array. However, some users were beginning to use very large arrays (e.g. 2,000,000
    channels). In this case it took several seconds to read each array. Because the
    MCA records were synchronous, this blocked execution of other EPICS records and
    tasks while reading the hardware. This was unacceptable, leading to channel access
    disconnects and other bad effects.</p>
  <p>
    One way to fix this would be to make the drivers asynchronous, meaning that device
    support will do the I/O in a separate thread, and the records will not block. This
    is how other slow drivers for the MCA records work, for example the Canberra AIM
    and the XIA DXP modules. However, this approach cannot be used with the SIS drivers
    because they must support the EPICS "scaler" record, and the scaler record does
    not work properly with asynchronous device suppport.</p>
  <p>
    Instead, the drivers were rewritten so that the FIFO is read out into a driver buffer
    in a low-priority background thread. When the MCA or waveform records process they
    now just read the data from this driver buffer using a memcpy() call, which is very
    fast. Furthermore on the 3820 the driver now reads the FIFO using DMA over the VME
    bus. This yields a factor of 10 improvement in speed, over 40MB/s, compared to 4MB/s
    with program I/O.</p>
  <p>
    The new drivers have excellent performance with very large arrays, and arrays with
    more than 10 million elements can now be used if the VME CPU has sufficient memory.
    For example, a test was done with the following configuration:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>SIS3820 module with 512MB of FIFO memory </li>
    <li>MVME 5100 CPU with 512MB of memory </li>
    <li>vxWorks 5.4.2 with Andrew Johnson's BSP with DMA support </li>
    <li>2 active inputs </li>
    <li>10,000,000 channels per waveform </li>
    <li>2 waveform records </li>
    <li>Internal channel advance </li>
    <li>1 microsecond dwell time </li>
    <li>ReadAll.SCAN = Passive </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The theoretical time for this acquisition to complete is 10 seconds. The following
    is the output from the EPICS "camonitor" program on a Linux client looking at the
    Acquiring PV, and the first 2 channels of each waveform record:</p>
  <pre>
    &gt;camonitor -tc -#2 SIS:3820:mca1 SIS:3820:mca2 SIS:3820:Acquiring 
    SIS:3820:Acquiring             (2011-05-01 11:19:35.050808) Acquiring 
    SIS:3820:mca1                  (2011-05-01 11:19:46.017134) 2 50 50 
    SIS:3820:mca2                  (2011-05-01 11:19:46.017223) 2 0 0 
    SIS:3820:Acquiring             (2011-05-01 11:19:46.017264) Done 
  </pre>
  <p>
    So the time between when acquisition started and when the client received the data
    and the Acquiring=Done status was 10.97 seconds. There is thus less than 1 second
    of overhead in collecting 2 waveforms of 10,000,000 elements each, which is 80MB
    of data.</p>
  <p>
    Note that the DMA function calls used in this driver are to the functions provided
    in Andrew Johnson's library for vxWorks.&nbsp; It would be very desireable if these
    functions were included in the EPICS devLib library in EPICS base, so they would
    work on any EPICS system that can perform DMA. Until this is done users with other
    DMA libraries will have to write wrapper functions to emulate the API in Andrew
    Johnson's library.</p>

    Scaler record operation</h2>
  <p>
    In addition to support for the MCA record, the driver supports the EPICS scaler
    record. Switching between scaler mode and MCA mode is handled automatically. It
    is important, however, that when acquiring in one mode that acquisition be allowed
    to complete before starting acquisition in the other mode. It is also important
    when acquiring in MCA mode to disable AutoCount in scaler mode, or else the MCA
    acquisition may be interrupted. This should be handled automatically by the logic
    in the database.</p>
  <p>
    The SIS3820 supports true preset-scaler operation, generating a VME interrupt when
    counting is complete. The SIS3801 does not support this, it simply counts into the
    FIFO. In scaler mode the driver sets the SIS3801 for an internal channel advance
    time of 0.01 seconds. It then reads the FIFO 100 times per second and stops as soon
    as it detects that the preset counts have been reached. This means that it can count
    for up to 0.01 second longer than the preset value. However, all inputs count for
    exactly the same time, and the actual time is accurate, so data normalization should
    be straightforward.

  <h2 id="Startup">
    Startup script</h2>
  <p>
    The mca/iocBoot/iocVxWorks contains example vxWorks startup scripts for the SIS3801
    and SIS3820. st_SIS3820.cmd simply invokes st_SIS3820.iocsh, which contains iocsh
    commands rather than vxWorks shell commands to allow for the use of environment
    variables which simplifies the code and makes it easier to understand and modify.</p>
  <p>
    There are 2 functions which are intended to be called from the startup script before
    iocInit, drvSIS3801Config and drvSIS3820Config</p>
  <pre>drvSIS3801Config(portName,            # The name of the asyn port to be created
                 baseAddress,         # The base VME A32 address
                 interruptVector,     # The VME interrupt vector
                 interruptLevel,      # The VME interrupt level
                 maxChannels,         # The maximum number of channels (time bins) to use
                 maxSignals)          # The number of inputs to use (1-32)


drvSIS3820Config(portName,            # The name of the asyn port to be created
                 baseAddress,         # The base VME A32 address
                 interruptVector,     # The VME interrupt vector
                 interruptLevel,      # The VME interrupt level
                 maxChannels,         # The maximum number of channels (time bins) to use
                 maxSignals,          # The number of inputs to use (1-32)
                 useDMA,              # Enable DMA (1) or disable DMA (0) 
                 fifoBufferWords)     # The number of 32-bit words to read from FIFO into buffer
                                      # Maximum = 2MW = 0x200000
</pre>
  <p>
    maxSignals is the number of input signals which will be used, in the range 1 to
    32. maxSignals controls how many scaler values will be copied to the FIFO each time
    a Next signal is received. Set this value to the actual number of signals actually
    being used to conserve FIFO memory on the card and vxWorks buffer memory in the
    driver. The number of MCA records which can be attached to this card is also controlled
    by maxSignals.</p>
  <p>
    maxChannels is the maximum number of channels (time points) that will be used in
    any MCA or waveform record connected to this card. The number of bytes of IOC buffer
    memory allocated by the driver for this card is maxChans * maxSignals * 4, so set
    this value to the actual maximum number of channels to be used in any record to
    conserve memory.</p>
